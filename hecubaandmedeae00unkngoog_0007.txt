IN the preparation of this ’ edition of the Hecuba
a'nd Medea of Euripides, 1 have consulted‚ and beg
to express my obligations to, the works of Mr.
F. Paley, Hermann, Pflugk, Elmsley, Porson,
Schone‚ Schaefer, and the Editor of *the Oxford
Pooket Classica. The text will be found to be in
general that of Dindorf. When I have departed
from it, it has been to follow more closely the
reading of the manuscriptS‚ except in the two or
three cases in which very strong metrical con-
sideratione have led me to adopt emendations pro·

posed by Hermann.
