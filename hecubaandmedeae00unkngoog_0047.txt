NOTES ΟΝ THE HECUBA.

—4—

Tur. Hecuba of Euripides was probably written about the year nc.
424, as Miiller argues from the fact that Aristophanes quotes from it
in vv. 1165-6, of his play of the Nubes, published B.0. 423.

ὦ τέκνον, ὦ παῖ, ἔξελθ’ οἴκων,
ἄῖε σοῦ πατρός.

He also thinks that there is a reference to the disaster that befell the
Spartans at Pylos Β.ο. 425, in v. 650, sqq.

στένει δὲ καί τις ἀμφὶ τὸν εὔρουν Εὐρώταν
Λάκαινα πολυδάκρυτος ἐν δόμοις κόρα.

Unless this reference be considered too vague to allow of an argu·
„ment’s being built upon it, the date will thus have been ascertained.
The interest of the play, taken as a whole, centres in the chief figure,
Hecuba, whose character, under the stimulus of intense passion, it is
the great object of the poet to delineate. She is first introduced as
expecting the advent of some new misfortune‚ in consequence of

⁸- an ill-omened dream under which she has been suffering. This fore-

boding is soon verified by the announcement that the Greeks have
determined to sacrifice her daughter Polyxena to the Manes of Achilles,
in order to obtain a fair wind for their homeward voyage. Hereupon
she and her daughter break forth into wild lyric stt-ains, indicative of
their desolation of spirit, till Ulysses comes to execute the will of the
Greeks by taking Polyxena off to be sacrificed. Hecuba has hardly

recovered from the swoon into which she has been thrown by her .

daughter’s departure, and gathered a sad consolation from the recital
of the nobility of soul that she shewed in dying, than another and even
bitterer missortune comes upon her. Her only surviving son, Poly-
dorus, who, she fondly hoped, was destined to revive the glories of her
house, has been cruelly murdered for the sake of his wealth by his
guardian and guest-friend Polymestor. Hecuba's grief is now too
deep for team. She dries her eyes, and sits sternly down, and medi·
tates revenge. With the concurrence of Agamemnon, whom, with the
ascendancy of a superior mind, she sways to her will, she invites Poly-
mestor and his children to a conference‚ and puts out his eyes, after
slaying his children before him, that the last sight he has gazed on
may also be the most terrible‚ and haunt him for ever after.
