powers, deep in feeling, dai-ing amne in specfflation and action, fertile
m resources, able at once to plot skilfully and carry out with success
whatever she has plotted.

The character next in interest and importance is Polyxena. Her
willingness to die free rather than live a slave, her grief that the death
she looks on asa gain to herself, must be nothing but a bare loss to her
mother, the care with which she preserves her own and her mother’s
dignity intact, the cour-age and modesty and grace with which she
meets her death, embody the highest heathen idea of womanly virtue.

Agamemnon is depicted as a just and noble-hearted prince, who is
most solicitous to do what is right ; but he is wanting in personal
dignity and decision of character, and is a mere tool in the skilful
hands of Hecuba.

Ulysses is only introduced in one scene; and there is, therefore, but
little opportunity afforded for the elaboration of his character. But
the skill with which, when hard pressed by Hecuba, he explains how his
gratitudo to her would compel him to protect her from harm, but does
not compel him to protect her daughter, is quite in keeping with his
reputation for subtlety and a power of drawing fine distinctions.

Polymestor* is a monster of iniquity, such as the world never saw.
Fierce, revengeful, treacherous, avaricious, fond of making dark allu-
sions in mockery of Hecuba, and in mere wanton joy over his crime,
grieving more for the loss of his own eyesight than for the death of
his children,-he has but the outside semblance of a man. He is simply
a devil, and has probably been drawn as such in order to make the
terriple revenge of Hecuba, and her cruel joy, seem less unnatural and

revo tin .

‘ It is agn 'old remark that Euripides hates the whole race of heralds,
and delights to make them ridiculous. In the present instance, how-
ever, the description given by Talthybius of the circumstances attend·
ing the death of Polyxena, is one of the most pleasing and touching in
the play, and is, in fact, hardly to be surpassed in pathos and delicacy
by anything in the circle of the Greek drama. '

The Chorus consiste of captive Trojan' women, who first come in to
announce the impending sacrifice of Polyxena, using the anapaestic
measure, as they march in chanting the pao-odos, or entrance-song

vv. 100--1 54). Their next office is, to introduce Ulysses to the audience
v. 216). When he departs with Polyxena, they sing an ode (vv. 444—
483) in the soft and liquid Glyconic measure. The ode, however,
which they sing, has nothing at all to do with the sorrows of Hecuba
or the early fate of Polyxena, butis a mere expression of wonder where
their ultimate place of captivity is to be. Then they name Talthybius
(v. 48⁷), when the actor personating him appears, ,that the audience

unnaturally vicious as that of Polymestor, see his Poetics, c. xiii„ and Hermann’n
commenta on it in his Preface to the Hecuba.
