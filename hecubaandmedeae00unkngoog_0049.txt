When the handmaiden comes in bearing the body of Polydorus, they
reprove her for uttering an ill-omened c (v. 661) 3 they sympathise
with Hecuba, when she discovers whoserhody it is (v. 692), introduce
Agamemnon on his entrance upon the stage (v. ⁷25), marvel at the
accordance between the view of Hecuba and that of Agamemnon as to
the propriety of punishing Polymestor (w. 846—849)‚ and break forth
into a Glyconis strain of exquisite beauty and melody, describing the
sack of Troy, as it must have appeared in the eyes of a young bride,
just roused from fancied seourity by the shout of hostile war to see her
husband suddenly slaughtered before her eyes, and all her happy
world Oo5f love1 burst like a bubble, and disappear in a moment for ever

vv, 9 -95 .

( The next ch)0ral ode (vv. 1025—1034) is dochmiac, and represents by
its altered tone and measure the fiercer and more impetuous feeling of
indignant satisfaction that possesses the Chorus, as it sees Polymestor
move on to his doom. It interprets to the audience what is going on
within Hecuba's tent (v. 1036, sqq.), expresses some slight commisera-
tion for Polymestor's sufferings (v. 1085), as he utters his agon also in
dochmiacs (vv. 1056—1084), explains to him that what has bef len him
comes from God (vv. 1086-7), defends the female sex in answer to his
attack on them (vv, 1183—1186), pronounces Hecuba's speech to have
more truth in it than his (vv. 1238-9), and finally winds up the play
with the usual exodic strain, and the not less usual declaration that
fate is invincible, and man the mere plaything of the circumstances
into the midst of which he is thrown (vv. 1293—1295).

Chorus in most of his plays sins both against its original use and
against dramatic unity. It necessarily follows from the laws that‘regu·
late dramatic composition, that the chorus should be looked upon in
the same light as the other actors in the play are looked upon, and
take its share in the action of the piece. Every word. it says should
have reference to the incidents‚ and help on the catastrophe. At the
same time Greek usage demanded that it should occupy the platform
of “ the ideal spectator,’' and extract the general principle underlying
the particular actions brought forward in the course of the play, always
taking the side of morality and. justice, and ranging itself against

the play hse’fore us it'win be observed gat, wilth the exception of ’the
pau-odos or entrance-song, hardly any of the songs help on the action
of the drama, or dwell on the emotions that might naturally be excited
by the situation or woes of Hecuba.

Another departure from strict dramatic propriety is to be found in
the commencement of the prologus, which is purely epical in its
character, iuasmuch as it is a mere description of bygone acts, as eon-
tradistinguished from actions evolving themselves from the forces seen
at work by the spectator. 'Phe excuse made by Mulier for this inser
