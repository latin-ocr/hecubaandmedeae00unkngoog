88 NOTES ΟΝ

tion of the purely epical element is that, “as it was the sole object of
Euripides in his plays to represent men under the influence of passion,
he found it necessary to lay before the spectator a concise statement
of the circumstances which had brought them to that point, in order
that he might be able, as soon as the piece actually began, to paint the
particular passion in all its strength!

With regard to the three unities, it may be remarked that those of
time and place are strictly observed. The events that occur in the
course of the drama may all have been crowded into the compass of a
day, and the place is the same throughout, viz„ a part of the Thracian
Chersonesus. (See Hermann‘s excellent note on v. 30 of his edition of
the Hecuba.) But with regard to the unity of action, the only unity
on which it is now thought necessary to insist, we fail (as Hermann
and others point out) to find one well-connected plot, naturally leading
up to and finally resolving itself into a noteworthy catastrophe at the
end3 but there are two plote, not necessarily connected with each
other, and in fact having nothing to do with each other, but brought
together to show forth what, as has been already observed, Euripides
cares for more than for anything else, the development of strong =
passion in his central figure, Hecuba. This arrangement has perhaps
been both found fault with and praised by critics more than it
deserved ς some maintaining that the play is contemptible‚ and others
that it is perfect ; the fact being that, as a work of art, it cannot, in
consequence of this defect, be allowed to stand in the first rank, though
there is very much in it that none but a first-rate artist could have
written. For, while it must be allowed ‘that Hermann is right in
asserting that the play, as it stands, is made up of two disconnected
portione, of which the former might very well, with a little elaboration
of incident, have been made to stand as an entire tragedy by itself,
whereas the latter is of very inferior merit, and has fewer tragic capa-
bilities3 still the character of Hecuba is so strongly marked, and so
well maintained, that it may be reasonably argued that the unity of
her character would prevent the spectator-s from being troubled at the
double nature of the action. The conclusion of the play, however, in
which Euripides resorts to the principle involved in his favourite
expedient of the Deus ex machina, by making Polymestor repeat the .
predictions of a Thracian seer about the ultimate fates of Agamemnon,
Cassandra, and Hecuba, will be given up, I suppose, by every one as
utterly disappointing‚ below the dignity of the occasion, and incon·
sistent with the idea involved in the conception of tragedy.
