This scene, bein anterior to the entrance of the Chorus, would be
called by the Greeks (see Arist. Poet. c. xii.) the πρόλογος, οι· prologus.
'l'his use of the term must be distinguished from the later use of it,
which would limit it ιο the monologue at the beginning of the play.
Each of the following scenos, with the exception of the last, was called
ἐπεισόδιον, “an insertion ” or ‘⁸ interpolation,” as being added ιο the
lyric passages at a later period, and included all that came between two
choral odes; ¹yvhile the last scene was appropriately called. the ἔξοδος,

Polydoffus then, seeing his mother approaching, quits the stage; and
Hecuba enters, supported by some Trojan women, who were formerly
her servants, but are now her fellows in captivity. She tells her
weakness and her ill-omened dreams, and expresses her fears that her
cffidffiflyxena, may be demanded by the Greeks to appease the shade

The metre of Hecuba's speech, in order to express the wild emotions
of sorrow under which she is labouring, consiste chiefly of irregular
anapaestic dimeters, sometimes acatalectic, sometimes catalectic, or
brachycatalectic, having a large proportion of spondees, and being
nlilarked by other irregularities, the chief of which will be noticed as

There are also two pair of hexameters ιο mark the more emphatic
portione of her monody.

1. It is worth while comparing the way in which Shakspeare intro-
duces the ghost in Hamlet with the way in which Euripides introduces
the ghost of Polydorus in the play before us. In the one case the
apparition appears only after the mind has been prepared for it. It is
the witching hour of night3 it is bitter cold ς the silence has been so
intense that not a meuse has been stirring, and the very moment when
the visitation had before occurred has just come round. In the other
case the ghost comes in in broad day, with a business-like air, as if
such events were common and to be expected, and enters, in the
beginning of his speech, into a long detail of family history, which

indeed, he shows an intimate acquaintance with what is going to hgppefi
in the course of the play3 but that is done, in all probability, partly
to form an artificial connection between the two actions of which the
play is composed, and partly to make his appearance and what he says
seem less unnatural.-‘'1-11cw, “ 1 have come,'' like οἴχομαι, has a present·
perfect meaning. I am cominy, is ἔρχομαι.

3. γεγὼςεῶν.-τῆς Κισσέως, “the daughter of Cisseus.” Homer
(11. xvi. 718) makes Hecuba, the daughter of Dymas. Hence, Hermann
says, the use of γεγὼς for ὥν, “ quod signatius putavit dicendum esse,
