to intimate that the scene of the play was not laid in the Chersonese,
and τήνδε would show that it was. . .

11. πέσοι and εἴη are in the optative mood after ἐκπέμπει, because,
being a historie present, it is equivalent to a past tense. ,

13. νεώτατος δ’ ἦν. So Homer, who, however, makes him the son of

Laothoe (11. xxi. 84), says of him (n ιι. 408),

τὸν δ’ οὔτι πατὴρ εἴασκε μάχεσθαι
οὕνεκά οἱ μετὰ πᾶσι νεώτατος ἔσκε γόνοιο

previous 1ἰηο.-θεοδμήτῳ, “ sacred to the gods.”

24. Αχιλλέως is a trisyllable, the two last syllables eoaleseing. So,
“fluminis alveo,” in Virgil.

27. ἔχῃ. The subjunctive is put after a. past tense, where an opta·
tive might be expected, when the effect of the aetion is to be repre·
sented as continuing till the present time. Thus ἔχῃ = ‘⁸ he might

long wishing and still wish.” ³
