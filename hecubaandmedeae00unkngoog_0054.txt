both gifted with prophetie powers. Paley quotes the Scholiast: εἴη

the verb to be in the singular after the disjunctive conjunction.

90. αἵμονι means either “ bloody,” from αἷμα, or, as Hermann thinks,
“eager‚'' from ἆΐσσω, “ Ῑ rush,” which he looks on as also connected
with αἷμα. See Iliad, V. 49, αἵμονα θήρης.

the second foot ought not properly to be a dactyl.

SCENE ΙΙ.

A Caenus of Trojan women, now captives to the Greeks, comes in in
marching order to warn Hecuba (vv. loo—154) that the Greeks have
resolved to appease the manes of Achilles by offering Polyxena in
sacrifice to him, and that Ulysses is coming to take her away with him.
Hecuba bursts into an agony of grief, and calls Polyxena out of her
tent to communicate the sad news (vv. 155—197). Polyxena expresses
her deep regi-et, but at the same time shows that her sorrow is more
for her mother than for herself (vv. 198-215). Ulysses then comes to
take Polyxena away to death. Hecuba attempta to move him to get
the Greeks to sacrifice Helen or herself instead of Polyxena (vv. 216—
331). Polyxena persuades her mother to leave off trying to evade
what is not to be evaded, declares that she would for her own part
rather die than live ; and after the interchange with her mother of a
few sentences expressive of the tenderest affection, goes away intrepidly
with Ulysses to die (vv. 342—487).

Hecuba then faints away, and the Chorus, struck by the inevitableness
of the doom that has come down on Polyxena, now that she is no
longer a free agent but a slave, begin to wonder whither fate will lead
them, whether to the Peloponnesus, or to Phthia, or to Delos, or to
Athens, and then concludes with a burst of grief over the destruction
of their country, and their own consequent sorrows.

‘l'he metre used by the chorus in vv. 100-154 is the one usually

regular measure of the same kind used by Hecuba would be less
fitting in the mouth of the chorus, whose feelings would naturally be
more under control than those of the bereaved mother.
