THE HECUBA. 45

206. μόσχον. See note on v· 144.

211. βίον. It would perhaps be better, with Hermann, to omit the
comma after βίον, and connect βίον, not with δύστανε, but with κλαίω, as
Polyxena seems not only to consider her mother unhappy in the events
of her life, but also to lament that she has to live. See the next

three lines.

214. permonet. Hermann says of these and similar words, such ’

though it might be with the, spectatore looking towards it, as we are,
told in Holy Writ that Daniel prayed looking towards Jerusalem.
But, as Hermann remarks, Euripides might mean to represent the
Greeks, or a deputation of them, as returning to Sigeum for the con-
summation of the sacrifice : not that such a course of action would be
likely in itself, but because the improbability would not strike spec-
tatore, who would only hear the matter indirectly alluded to, and
nowhere distinctly stated.

224. ἐπέστη, “was appointed.'’ See ἐπιστάτης in the line before—narr
Ἀχιλλέως, i. e. Pyrrhus or Neoptolemus.

226. οἶσθ’ οὖν ὅ δρᾶσον, “Do then, knowest thou what 2”= “ Do you

27127. ’γίγνωσκε ἀλκὴν, “ acknowledge your strength‚” i. 0. “ your want
of strength to resist me.”

228. τοι often introduces a moral apophthegm, as in the present

ωὲἓῗῗθιὲἀγὼ, i. e. “ 1 as well as Polyxena ;'’ the καὶ instituting a com·

parison between Hecuba's misery and helplessness‚ and the misery and
helplessness of Polyxena.

232. τρέφει, i. e. “has preserved and still presel-ves me.'’

233. κακῶν, “ than my past evils.”

rendering would account for the tense of εἶρῆσθαι; but, as Paley
remarks, it makes ἀκοῦσαι govern the accusative of the person. Hence
it is probably preferable to translate: “ Itis fitting that a full state·
ment of our case should have been laid before you, and then that 1
who question you should in my turn hear what you have to answer.”
See Paley’s note on the passage. ·
