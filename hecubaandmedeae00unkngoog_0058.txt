4³ NOTES ΟΝ

somewhat by Hermann to τε, as more forcible 3 τε, however, is the
reading of most MSS.

241. φόνου σταλαγμοὶ. How could. drops of blood ooze from his
eyes? it is asked. Because Ulysses had bruised and wounded his eyes
on purpose, before he came to Troy as a spy, in order partly not to be
recognised, and partly to excite compassion and allay suspicion. So
Zopyrus acted in Herod. iii. 154, and Sinon in Virg. AEn. ἰί-κατέσταζον
10.ὴοΥο transitive.

242. ἄκρας καρδίας, “ the surface of my heart.’' The whole passage
will be equivalent to “It made no slight impression on me‚’' ‘⁸ it
touched me to my very heart's core.''

244. ἐλθόντες. The participle is used for the infinitivo after verbs
of the senses. See Matth. Gr. Gr. ξ 548, 1.

246. ἑνθανεῖν σοῖς πέπλοις, “ clung to thy robe with such convulsive
force that it grew stiff as death.” · ·

250. ὥστε . . . γε, “yes, so as to,” dac. ,

253. δύνῃ. Porsen prefers δύνᾳ, with the Scholiast‚ as more Attic.
Hermann, however, proscribes δύνᾳ as Doric. Lobeck, Matthiae, and
others maintain that δύνᾳ is the indicative form (as in Soph. Phil. 798,
οὗ δύνᾳ μολεῖν ποτε ;), and that δύνῃ is the form for the subjunctive, aud
is therefore the proper form in this line.

255. μηδὲ γιγνώσκοισθέ μοι, “may you be not even known to me.''
The verb is in the optative to express a wish.

256. βλάπτοντες οὐ φροντίζετε, “ you do not mind injuring.'' So
ἕκωέένὲη ’γὰρ Παλλὰς οὐκ ἀνέξεται, in Eur. Heracl. 352. See Matth. Gr.

r. 5 0.

258. τί δὴ σόφισμα τοῦθ’, “ what is this ingenious device whicb,'' διο.

260. τὸ χρῆν, “ necessity,”is a shorter form for τὸ χρῆναι. Paley com-
pares (ῆν from ζάω or (ἣμι.

264. εἴργασται, governs two accusatives.

265. χρῆν, i. e. ἐχρῆν, “oportuit.” See note on v. 1218.

271. τῷ μὲν δικαίῳ, κ.τ.λ., is literally, “ I contend this (contest of>
argument with justice ; ’' i. e. “ Ι claim that justice to be on my side
which you say is on yours.”

273. χερὸς . . . παρηΐδος. To touch these was the common form of

278. μηδὲ makes its last syllable long before κτάνητε.-τῶν τεθνηκό-
των ἅλις. So Eur. Or. 240, ἅλις ἔχω τοῦ δυστυχεῖν.

280. “ παραψνχῆ penultimam corripit, utpote ab aoristo secundo
deductum. Eadem est ratio in διατριβὴ, a διατρίβω.” Porson.

283. δοκεῖν, “to think ;’' as oftenin Homer. SoSt.James i. 20, Εἴ τις
δοκεῖ θρῆσκος εἶναι ἐν ἱμῖν, “if any man among you seem to be (i. e.
thinks that he is) religious.''-e?› πράσσειν is, as Pflugk remarks, a little
