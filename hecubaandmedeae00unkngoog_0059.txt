THE HECUBA. 4⁷

περὶ ὕβρεως in Demosth. in Mid. . 529, Ἐάν τις ὑβρίσῃ εἵς τινα, ἦ παῖδα
ἦ γυναῖκα ἦ ἄνδρα, τῶν ἐλευθέρων ἦ) τῶν δούλων, κ.τ.λ.
293. τὸ δ’ ἀξίωμα, &c., “your authority, even though you should
speak unconvincingly, will prevail.” The translation of these lines by
Ennius is quoted by the Commentators ε

Haec tu etsi pervorse dices, facile Achivos flexeris.
N am opulenti quum loquuntur pariter atque ignobiles.
Eadem dicta eademque oratio aequa non aeque valet.

295. ταύτὸν is put for ταύτὸ, i. e. τὸ αὐτὰ-τῶν δοκούντωνετῶν ἐνδόξων
ὄντων, “ those seeming to be somewhat.’'

296. στερρὸς φύσις would commonly be στερρὰ φύσις ; the adjective
being generally of three terminatione. .

299. τῷ θυμουμένῳ is a rare uae of the participle for the infinitive,
and=vcp θυμούσθαι, proe ird. Scholefield quotes a similar use of the
participle in Thuc. iii. 43, ἐν τῷ τοι ’”δε ἀξιοῦντι, dum res ita aestimam ,·
and v. 9, τοῦ ὑπαπιέναι πλέον ἢ τοῦ [agones.

300. ποιοῦ φρενί, “ consider in your mind.''

d 302. οὐκ ἄλλως λέγω, i. e. “ 1 will never deny my obligation to
ο so,'’ .

305. Pflugk saysj “Vulgo supplent δεῖν, cujusmodi ellipsi opus non
est. Vide Orest. 269, Οἷς μ’ εἶπ’ Ἀπόλλων ἐξαμύνασθαι Bias?

306. κάμνουσιν, “ err.’'

Α 309. ἡμῖν, “ at our hands.'' So Xen. Mem. i. 1., ἄξιός ἐστι θανάτου τῇ
πόλει, i. e. “at the hands of the state.''

311. βλέποντι, “while living.’' So δέρκομαι is used. See Homer, 11.
i. 88, Οὕτις ἐμεῦ ζῶντος καὶ ἐπὶ χθονὶ δερκομένοιο.

312. χρώμεσθαεχρῶμεθα.

313. εἶενπεειο, “ well, be it so.’' “ It appears‚” says Matth„ “ to have
been retained in the language of common life from the old εῑε for εἴη,
with ν ἐφελκ. ,· for the sense requires the singular?

315. ποτερα μαχούμεθ’, κ.τ.λ. Hermann rightly warns us against
taking these words as spoken by any one but Ulysses in his own per-
son. If they were intended to be put into the mouth of the person
alluded to in the words τί δῆτ’ ἐρεΐτις, the verbs would be in the delibe-
rative subjunctive.

5317 . καθ’ ἡμέραν may qualify either ἔχοιμι or ἀρκούντως ἔχοι, but not
ωΙΙΤι. .
1ἓξ9. ἀξιούμενον, “honoured;” for a similar use Hermann quotes Or.

320. διὰ μακροῦ ἡ χάρις. So Soph. Antig. 76, ἐκεῖ γὰρ ἀεὶ κείσομαι.

322. ἄθλιαι agrees with γυναῖκες rather than with πρεσβῦται, because
it is nearer to it.

325. ἥδε, i. e., “ close by,” the scene of the play being laid not in
TroaS, but on the Thracian Chersonese. See note on v. 221.

326. τόλμα, “ endure‚’' like the Latin tolerare, See v. 333, and else
where in this play.
ὃφ327.ιίιόἰμιιιθίιιιν ὀφλήσομεν. So Soph. Antig„ σχεδόν τι μωρῷ μωρίαν

λισκ ω.

811329. ἡγεῖσθε and θαυμάζετε are imperativa, as the preceding μήτε
owe.

330. ὡς ἂν, as Hermann says, = dummodo, σι’ modo ,· and henco even-
