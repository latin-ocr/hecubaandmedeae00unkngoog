tually becomes almost equivalent to ut. See AEsch Prom. Vinct. 10,

ὥς ἂν διδαχθῇ τὴν Διὸς τυραννίδα Στέργειν.

332. Τὸ δοῦλον . . . πεφυκέναι. The construction, as Hermann,
quoting the old Scholiast, suggests, is not that τὸ δοῦλον πεφυκέναι is the
subject, and κακὸν (ἐστι) the predicate, but that τὸ δοῦλον is the sub-
ject, and πεφυκέναι is added by way of correction (ὥσπερ ἐπανορθοῖ ’τον
λόγον), αηᾶεῶστε εἷς ὕπαρξιν ἐλθεῖν; so that the whole passage is equi-
valent to, “ How great an evil is slavery to live in” (i. e. ὥστε πεφυ-
κένέἕ δοῦλοιέἐ6“ and it has to endure indignities‚”&c. For τολμᾷ, see
no on v. .

335. φροῦδοι. 'l'he copula is left out after this word. See v. 162.

338. πάσας . . . φθογγὰς ἱεῖσα, “giving utterance to all thy notes.’'
- The shortening of the antepenultima in ἱεῖσα, is worthy of notice from
its rarity. See, however, Sep. c. Theb. 494, and Iph. in Τ. 298.

342. δεξιὰν . . . κρύπτοντα. This Ulysses did for sear she should·
seize his right hand in supplication. See v. 273, and the note
on it.

343. ἔμπαλιν, “away-'⁹ -

845. πέφευγας τὸν ἐμὸν ἱκέσιον Δία, i. e. “ Non est quod verearis ne
supplicibus ego te verbis orans tuae erga J ovem pietati vim adhibere
velle videar.” Pflugk.

350. Τοῦτό μοι πρῶτον βίου, “hoc primum et summum vitae meae
esse deputo.” So Hermann, who adds that it cannot be translated,
‘⁴ this vgas the beginning of my life,” because such a rendering would re-

mre Τ ‘2' (0707.

q 352. <figor . . . ἔχουσα, κ.τ.λ., “ causing no small jealousy with

regard to my marriage, as to whose home and hearth Ι shall come to,''

instead of ‘⁸ Ι should come to,’' i. e. ἀφίξομαι, instead of ἇφιξοίμην. So
ἐΧθῑι. ⁴&nah iii. 6. 19, θαυμάζοντες ὅποι ποτὲ τρέψονται οἷ Ἕλληνες καὶ τί
ν ν οιεν.

355.χπαρθένοις . . . μέτα, “conspicua inter virgines? Herm. Μετὰ
governs the dative only in poeti-y, and=“ among.’' So Homer, 11. i.
252, μετὰ δὲ τριτάτοισιν ἄνασσεν.

356. ἴση θεοῖσι rather than θεῇσι, because, as Hermann observes, the
question is not about beauty, but about happiness. Hence no altera·
tion is necessary-maim τὸ κατθανεῖν, “ except with respect to death ; '⁹
where notice that τὸ κατθανεῖν is in the accusative, as expressing the
respect, in s ite of the presence of πλήν. See Matth. Gr. Gr. ἓ 543.

- 358. οὐκ ε vobs cv. Here, as εἰωθὸς is a participle, ὅν is, as elsewhere
il} the case, redundant. So Hom. Il. xix. 80, ἐπιστάμενόν περ ἐόντα. So
orson.

359. ὦμῶν φρένας, “ harsh of disposition.”

360. ὅστις is in the singular, though its antecedent, δεσποτῶν, is in
the plural. Δεσποτῶν, however, is necessarily equivalent to δεσποτοῦ,
as a slave would not have more than one master. But ὅστις frequently
differs in number from its antecedent. See Matth. Gr. Gr. ἕ 475, a,
who quotes Soph. Antig. 707,

ὅστις ’γὰρ αὐτὸς ἦ φρονεῖν μόνος δοκεῖ,
ἦ γλωσσὰν, ᾖν οὔκ ἄλλος, ἣ ψυχὴν ἔχειν,
οὗτοι διαπτυχθέντες ὤφθησαν κενοί.

362. ἀνάγκην σιτοποιὸν, “= the necessity of making broad*
