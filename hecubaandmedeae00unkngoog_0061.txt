THE HECUBA. 49

366. πρόσθεν, “ ἰοτωθιἹγΡ--τυράννων depends 'on ἠξιωμένα.

369. ἅγωνεᾶγαγὼν here3 the imperfect participle being put for the
aorist, as the Scholiast remarks, and as we, in our less accurate
language, often use it. See the same use of the imoergect participle for
the aorist in v, 386. -

370. του-ττινος.

371. θάρσος ἐλπίδος, “encouragement to hope.”

372. μῆτερ, σὺ δ’ ἡμῖν, “do you, then, my mother.” For the insertion
of δὲ see Porsen's remark on Orest. 614, “, Cum subito sermonem ad
alium ab alio convertimus, primo nomen ponimus, deinde pronomen,
deinde particulam.” ,

377. μᾶλλον, as Hermann remarks, is not redundant here with the
comparative εὐτυχέστερος, though such a construction is comm0n3 but
here it rather refers to what goes before, and qualifies the whole
sentence, thus: ὁ ἀλγῶν μᾶλλον ἂν εἴη εὐτυχέστερος θανὼν ἢ (ὢν, i. e.,
“ the unfortunate man is rather to be counted happier when dead than
when alive.'’

379. δεινὸς χαρακτὴρ κᾶπίσημος, “ strong (lit. strange) and deeply
marked is the impress.”—For this use of, δεινὸς, see Prom. Vinct. 39,
τὸ συγγενές τοι δεινὸν ἥ θ’ ὁμιλία.

380. ἐσθλῶν γενέσθαι, “ to have been born of noble parents? So Xen.

the same confusion in language between outward rank and moral quali·
{³⁶⁸1 that is made in practice when “the learned pate ducks to the golden
oo .''

381. ὅνομοι is not the subject of the sentence, but the accusative aster
, ἐπὶ. If it were the subject, it would have the article with it, and be
read τοῦνομα. Thus the whole line should be, “ and rises to a greater
name for nobleness in the case of those who act worthily of their
birth.'' That is, “ He is noble who is nobly born ς but the nobleman
who acts nobly is the noblest of all.” So Shakspeare (All’s Well that
Ends well, ii. 3) says, conversely,

This is honour’s scorn
Which challenges itself as honour’s born,
- And is not like the sire.

382. καλῶς, “ nobly.''

386. ἄγοντες. See note on v. 369.

391. ἀλλὰ, “at any rate ”=⁸altem. This use of ἀλλὰ arises from au
abbreviated method of speaking 3 the whole line being equivalent to

ὑμεῖς δέ, εἰ μὴ μόνην με βούλεσθε φονεῦσαι, ἀλλὰ θυγατρὶ συμφονεύσατε.
Ρῦυςῐι. So, Soph. Electr. 411,

Ὦ θεοὶ πατρῷοι, συγγένεσθέ γ’ ἀλλὰ νῦν,

ι. e. εἴποτε συνεγένεσθέ μοι, ἀλλὰ νῦν γε cuneumve. Sec Viget. p. 471,
note.

395. μηδὲ is used with ὠφείλομεν, because it recorda a wisb, not a
fact, and= “ utinam m?

397. κεκτημένος is the participle after οῖδα, as being a verb of the
aenaea. See Matth. ἕ 648.

898. ὁποῖα κισσὸς δρυὸς ὅπως τῆσδ’ ἕξομαι. Porsen is disposed to con·
