sidet the construction to be ὅρα ὅπως τῆσδ’ ἕξομαι, ὁποῖα κισσὸς δρυός
But Hermann's explanation is simpler. He translates: ⁶9⁰ ut hedera
kuic ut quorem· adkaerebo, and looks upon the construction as a
pleonasm peculiar to passages, in which a comparison between two

things is instituted. Thus, in Troad. 147:

μάτηρ δ’ ὥς τις πτανοῖς κλαγγὰν
ὄρνισιν ὅπως ἑξαρξω ’γὼ
μολπάν.

i. e. ιιι mater eqo vobis ut pullis precib· cantum.

400. ὡς, according to Matthiae=3nt‚ “since,” and refers to some

406. πρὸς βίαν, “ violently.” This use of πρὸς ‚is naturally derived
from the common meaning of πρὸς, i. e. direction towards, asin the
phrase σκοπεῖν πρός τι, πρὸς τὸ δεινὸν ἔρχεσθαι.

408. ἃ πείσει, “ all which things you will have to endure‚'' i. e. “ if

411. πανύστατον, “ for the last time,” is an adverb, not an adjective
&galsffixssssffffiwms agree with the subject of ἄπειμι in v. 414',
the intermediate line, which is spoken by another person, having no
influence on the construction of Polyxena’s speech—bv, i. e. ὑμεναίων,
understood in ἀνυμέναιος. So πατήρ is understood in πατρῴα in v. 22.

418. ἐν ”Αιδου, i. e. ἐν Ἅιδου δόμοις.

419. ποῖ τελευτήσω βίον, “ whither shall I ρο and finish my life.” See

423. ἀθλιωτάτην, i. 0. οὖσαν.

425. ἀθλίας. Such is the reading of the MSS. But Porsen reads
ἀθλία, asserting, “ Valde invenustum est duplex epitheton ἀώρου
aeuus? Ι am, however, with Hermann, unable to see the harshness of
the double epithet here, especially as he suggests that ἀθλίας τύχης may
