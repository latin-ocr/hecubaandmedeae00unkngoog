THE HECUBA. 51

ξίφους and πυρᾶς both referring to the same moment of time. See Her·
mann's note on the passage.

438. προλείπω, “I am sainting.”—Abe†aa . . . μέλη. So Virg. AEn. i.
92, “ Solvuntur frigore membra. ’

441-443, Hermann proposes to put these three lines into the mouth
of the chorus, as it is difficult to imagine a fainting woman gathering
up energy to utter them. Το this it is objected that it is unusual for a
chorus to begin with two or three common iambic verses, and then
launch forth into an ode. Moreover it may be supposed that Hecuba
revives enough to utter the three verses slowly and by gasps, much as
Queen Katharine would be represented as acting the last part of Henry
vm„ Act iv. sc. 2, after it has been said of her,

How much her Grace is altered 0111) ghzoguddte‘iil
How long her face is drawn ἲ How pale she looks,
And of an earthy cold3 Mark her eyes l

441. ὣς, “ thus '' = οὕτως ἔχουσαν, or οὕτως ἀπολομένην.

442. The play on the words Ἑλένην and εἷλε was a favourite ons
{villzh the Greek tragedians' . See AEschylus Ag. 690, ἑλένας, ἕλανδρος,

λ πτολις.

444-483. For the mette of this choral song see the Introduction.
It will at once be perceived by any one who reads a few of the lines
aloud, how soft and musical the rhythm is 3 and, therefore, how suit-
able it is to embody the outpourings of captive women, bemoaning
their lot, and sadly wondering what their future is to be. The general
tenor of the song will be found in the outline given of Scene IL, near
the end. To what is there said may be added Mr. Paley’s observation‚
that “ a more appropriate subject might have been furnished by the
immediate prospect of Polyxena's fate.” See also some remarks to the
same effect in the Introduction. ·

444. ποντιὰς is a feminine adjective in the nominative case, agreeing
with αὔ α.

449. ςιτηθεῖσα is used passively. δουλόσυνος, 'ernosto-a, “ possessed as
a slaves—⁷43 == τίνι is dependent on δουλόσυνος or οἷκον.

450. ὅρμον is the accusative of motion. So Phoen. 111, ἦλθε Πολυ·
νείκης χθόνα- Δωρίδος αἴας = the Peloponnese, as conquered by the

Dorians. Pflugk quotes Soph. OEd. Col. 696, μεγάλαν Δω ίδα νᾶσον.
⁸ 451. «bola, or Φθιῶτις included the southern part of hessaly as far
north as Pharsalus. Δ

463. Ἀπιδανὸν. The Apidanus, uniting with the Enipeus, flowcd
through the vale of Pharsalus into the celebrated Peneus. The writer
in Smith's Geog. Dict. quotes Lucan, vi. 37 4, ·

it gurgite rapto
Apidanus, nunquamque celer, nisi mixtus, Enipeus.

455. νάσων depends upon ἔνθα, “ to that one of the islands (viz.
Delos), where, '’ διο. If it depended on ὅρμον, there would be no island
specially alluded to, as is here evidently intended. This mention of
Delos, it has been conjectured, is here made because the Athenians
claimed the island as their own from Ol. 88. 3, in which year they
cleansed the island (See Thuc. iii. 104), and renewed the Delian
gemes. 'I'his is, as Hermann points out, an additional reason for
