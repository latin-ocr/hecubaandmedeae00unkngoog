THE HRGUBA. 53 ,

any one of the Greeks to touch her daughter's corpse, but to leave it

· to her to perform the funeral obsequies (vv. 686-608). She then

sends her old handmaiden to the sea to get the lustral water, and

goes herself to her own tent and the tents of her fellow captives to see ·

whether anything can be found still left to them in order to adorn
the dead fittingly (vv. 609-628). .

This portion of the play would be called by the Greeks the second
episodehssgraelaz'nng), as being the part inserted between the second and
third c o es. ·

The ode that follows (vv. 629-656), like the one preceding, is in
the Glyconic metre. Its general bearing is given briefly in the Intro-
duction, and will be fbund to be such as well suits the soft and sad
character of the measure employed.

484. δήποτε, “ but now,’' “ lately.’' See v. 891.

486. Hecuba is supposed to have become insensible after delivering
the speech beginning at v. 438, and to have afterwards been gently
placed on the ground, on her back, by the chorus.

488. ὀρᾶν, “ regard,” “look after ; '' like the Latin verb “respicere.”

489. ἄλλως = nil nisi, strengthens ματήν, or qualifies ψευδῆ. See
also v. 626.-Th0 subject of κεκτῆσθαι is either ἀνθρώπους, which, how· -
ever, does involve a slight anacoluthon, as Hermann says, or ratheris
δοκοῦνταὲ ln tho next line,

490. δοκοῦντας, κ.τ.λ., “men who think that the're is a race of Gods.’'
For the absence of the article in such indefinite expressions, not em-
bracing the whole of a class, see Matt. Gr. Gr. ἓ 271, Obs., and the
examples there given. The whole sentiment, though in consonance with
trains of thought common in the time of Euripides, is utterly at
variance with anything that can ever have occurred to Talthybius or his
cotem orarios.

493.P μέγα is used adverbially.

494. ἀνέστηκεὶι, “ has been laid waste.” “ In passive and intransitive
tenses it usually has a hostile sense.” Liddel and Scott. ο

497. ὅμως δέ, i. e. “though old3 and, therefore, not likely inthe course
of nature to have to suffer indignities long.'’

499. μετάρσιον . . . . ἔπαιρε = ἔπαιρε ὥστε μετάρσιον εἶναι. This is
called the proleptic (i. e. anticipatory) use of the adjective.

501. τίς οὗτος, “who is this who, '⁸ dcc„ i. e. “ who are you wh0,'' &a
I'IOrson quotes Hom. Il. x. 82, τίς δ’ οὗτος κατὰ νῆας ἀνὰ στρατὸγ ἔρχεαι
ο ος;

504. πέμψαντος . . . . με’τα == μεταπέμψαντος, “having sent after thee.”
Hermann quotes Thuc. i. 112, ἑξήκοντα μὲν νῆες ἐς Αἴγυπτον ἀπ’ αὐτῶν
ἔπλευσαν, Ἀμυρταίου μεταπέμποντος, “to prove 'that σε, the object of
μεταπέμψαντος, may be properly omitted. For μετὰ in the same sense
in composition, see vv. 509 and 512. For the tmesis, see Eur. Alc. 66,

ξύρυσθέως πέμψαντος ἵππειον με’τα
κημα.

G δοῖ, gono& is the nominative absolute: “it seeming good to the
