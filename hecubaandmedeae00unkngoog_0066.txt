54 NOTES ΟΝ

ΡΗηςΚ-θανουμένους is masculine, though referring to a woman, as is-
always the case when the plural is used for the feminine singular. ·

514. τούπί σε = τὸ ἐπί σε, “ as far as you are concerned.” So τὸ απὸ
τὸῧδε, τὸ ἐπὶ σφᾶς εἶναι.

515. πῶς καὶ = ‘⁶ dic praterea quomodo,· καὶ πῶς objicientis fere est
{el contradicelntis.” Porsen ad Phoen. 1373.—ap’ αἰδούμενοι, “ did you

o it reverent ?”

518. διπλᾶ δΞκρυα κερδᾶναι, “ to reap a double harvest of ἐρεῖ-εἶ’ So
virgil ii. 3, Infandum regina jubes renovare dolorem—For this use of
κερδᾶναι for “ to gain a loss,” see Acts xxvii. 21, κερδῆσαι τὴν ὕβριν ταύ-
την καὶ τὴν ζημίαν.

520. πρὸς τάφῳ, i. e. ἔτεγξα. See note on v. 57.

523. Ἀχιλλέως must be ronounced as a trisyllable.

524. πέλας δ’ ἐγώ i. e. στην, the intransitive second aorist being
understood from the transitive first aorist ἔστησα.

526. μόσχου. See note on v. 205. In both passages, however, there
is evidently a strong sacrificial reference.

528. ἔρρει is used here transitively. ' So ῥεῖν γάλα. Matt. (Gr. Gr.
ἓ 423) quotes Hom. Η. in Ap. ii. 202, προρέειν καλλίρροον ὕδωρ.

529. σημαίνει . . . μοι, “ he makes a sign to me, bids me.''

532. σῖγα with α short is an adverb. For other instances of adverbs
put with εἶναι and ’γίγνεσθαι for adjectives, see Matth. ξ 612. σίγα with
α long, is the imperative.

534. πατὴρ δ’ ἐμός = “idemque pater meus,” the μὲν corresponding .

to δὲ being omitted in ὦ παῖ Πηλέως. Pflugk.

535. δέξαι μοι, “receive at my hands? See note on v. 309.

536. νεκρῶν ἀγωγούς, “ evoking the dead.’'

537. ἀκραιφνὲς, “ proprie id est, quod modo ab ipso fonte exiit, eoque
ngndumMadulteratum est.'’ Hermann. Hence it answers exactly to the
1 ea in oore :—

Come, if the love thou hast for me
Be pure and fresh as mine for thee,
Fresh as the fountain underground,
When first 'tis by the lapwing found.

642. ἐπηύξατο, “joined in the prayer.’'

543. κώπης, “ by the hilt.” So Xenoph. Anab. i. 6, 10, ἐλάβοντο τῆς
ζώνης τὸν Ὀρόντην. See Matt. Gr. Gr. ἕ 331.

546. ὥς ἐφράσθη, “ when she perceived it.” ἐφρασάμην is the com·
moner aerist in this sense. Hermann, however, quotes Herod. vii. 46,
οὗτος ὧν ὡ’νήρ φρασθεὶς Ξέρξεα δακρύσαντα.

550. ὥς ἐλευθέρα θάνω, “ ut in morte saltem obeunda libera, non serva.
sim.’' Matth. Elmsley wishes to read ὡς ἐλευθέρως θάνω, “ that 1 may
die as becomes a free woman ; ’' which is a less noble sentiment.

552. κεκλῆσθαι αἰσχύνομαι = “ I am ashamed to be dalled3 and, there-
fore, do not wish to be called ‚·'’ αἰσχύνομαι κεκλημένη would mean,
“ 1 am ashamed of having been called, though I have been called.”

555. 1 have inserted this and the next line in brackets, though it is
impossible not to agree with Hermann, and most other editors, in
thinking that they are spur-ioue, on the ground that ὑστάτην ὅπα 'is an

expression of little meaning, that μεθῆκαν stands awkwardly between
the relative οὗπερ and its antecedent, that οὗπερ itself is wrongly
