THE 1-1130 UBA. 55

used, that ἣν ought to be in the present tense, and that the sub·
ject changes too abruptly in the next liue, it· these two lines be
admitted. Pflugk, however, tries to defend them, and makes the
best of them by translating ὑστάτην ὅπα by novissimma vocis sonum,
and giving -the sense of the whole passage as, “illi vero, φιαοιψνί-
mum finiverat orationem ie cujus summum erat imperium, amimam
affluam. ἐοῦπὲορ 27⁶² μέγιστον ἣν noda-os· is horrowed from the Homeris
v κρ τος στ μ ιστον.

560. ὡς ἀγάλματος. 8ο Tennyson, speaking of Cleopatra, says :—

With that she tore her robe apart, and half

'Phe polish’d argent of her breast to sight
Laid bare.

And again in th'e poem of OEnone:

but Pallas where she stood
Somewhat apart, her clear and bared limbs
O’erthwarted with the brazen·headed spear
Upon her pearly shoulder leaning cold‚

562. τλημονέστατον, “ most stent-hemed?

565. εὐτρεπὴς --· ἑτοῖμος.

568. ὅμως, preceded by ocal, is often used when a participle is in the
sentence. See Eur. Or. 679, κάγώ 0³ ἱκνοῦμαι καὶ γυνή περ οὗθ’ ὅμως.

569. Pflugk quotes ovid. Met. xiii. 47 9.

Tunc quoque cura fuit partes velare tegendas,
Quum caderet, castique decus servare pudoris.

f 89 Shakspeare, speaking of Caesar’s death, says, alluding to the same
00 1¹²8,

Then in his mantle muffiing up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statue,
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell. ,

574. φύλλοις ἔβαλλον. Pflugk refers to the φυλλοβολία, or casting of
leaves, or crowns made of leaves, to the winners at the gamen, a prac-
tice common as a sign of approbation in our own day. A nearer

approach to the feeling intended to be conveyed will be found in the
well-known ballad of the Babes in the Wood;

No burial these pretty babes
of any man receives,

'rin Robin Redbreast painfully
Did cover them with leaves,

„ So, too, Collina, but less simply τ

'I'he red-breast oft at evening hours
Shall kindly lend his little aid,
With hoary mose and gathered flowers,
To deck the ground where thou art laid.

576. ἤκουεν κακά (like the Latin phrase male audire), takes πρὸς τοῦ
φέροντος as the agent after it, as if it were a passive verb.

583. &wisent is intransitive, having δεινόν τι πῆμα for its subject.
