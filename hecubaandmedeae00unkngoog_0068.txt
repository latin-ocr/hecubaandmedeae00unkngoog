584. θεῶν ἀναγκαῖον τόδε, may be taken, as Hermann takes it, in
apposition with πῆμα, or may form a sentence by itself.

592. οὔκουν δεινῶς “Is it not strange then 2”'1·he introduction of
philosophical disquisitione of a later pgeriod is afault ιο which Euripides
is very prone. Here it is especially· offensive, because put into the
mouth of a mother weepIng over the recent loss of her daughter. -εἶ
γῆ μὲν κακὴ, κ. τ. λ. The same simile is used in the Epistle to the
Hebrews vi. 7. It may seem strange to us, who have an institution
whose express object is to teach virtue, to read disquisitions about the
impossibility· of its being taught, and t'he necessity that the bad should ·
always remain bad. As to the opinion that the good will always
remain good, this has now assumed the shape of the doctrine of final
perseverance. The other opinion, that the bad cannot be changed, has
quite been driven out by the facts of Christianity.

595. ἀνθρώποις, “as regards men,' ’is equivalent to ἐν ἆνθρωποις. It
cannot be denied that, as Hermann says, it is a very loose way of talk-
ing, to put the dative thus without a proposition. He suggests ἅνθρω-
ποι, which would bein apposition to ὁ μὲν and ὀ δὲ. He thinks, how·
ever, that the original reading was ἐν βροτοῖς δ’ ἀεί.

598. διέφθειρεβ ‘is wont to corrupt? So the Latin aorist ιε used ιο

:sifignffgr custom. So Horace uses the Latin aorist in Ι. Oarm. xxxiv.

599. Is it birth or education that makes all the differencei Euri·
· pides means to decide the question in favour of birth, as most
Greeks would have done, and as he has already made the chorus virtu-
ally decide ιιι vv. 379-3’81. He naturally, however, shrinks from the,
extreme consequences of his own theory, yand adds, thus vitiating m a
measure his argument, that education has something to do with the
matter. -τροφαί = αἶ τροφαί, ιο correspond with οἱ rendra-es. “peSae
unus articulus duobus substantivis sufficit.” But see also the note
on v. 490.

602. This is a beautiful anticipation of the true theory of Christian
education, which' ιε ιο teach virtue by showing the beauty of virtue,
not by showing the hideousness of vice.

605. μοι is the dativus ethicus. -νι-ἢς παιδός depends on θιγγάνειν,

ι though it may be supplied again after εἵργειν. For a similar parenthetic
insertion see v. 920, and the note on it.

607. ἀκόλαστος ὄχλος ναυτική τ’ ἀναρχία, κ. τ. λ. “Euripides avails
himself of every opportunity of touching on public events. in order to
give weight to his opinions on political subjecte, whether favoni-able or
