THE HEC UBA. 57

the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity.” So Soph. OEd. R. 17 6, vepera-
σον ἀμαιμακέτου πυρόε-κακὸς ὁ μή τι δρῶν κακόν, “ he is counted among
them as evil who will not join them in committing evil.” So St. Paul
(Rom. i. 32), speaks of ‘⁴ those who commit things worthy of death,
nl<1>t only doing the same, but also having pleasure in them that do
t em.” ·

610. ἔνεγκε ποντίας ἁλός, “bring (some) of the salt sea-water; ”' ἁλός
being the partitive genitive. So Thuc. ii. 66, τῆς γῆς ἔτεμον, “ they
ravaged part of the land. ”

612. Polyxena was νύμφη and ἅπάρθενος, because betrothed to Achilles,
ἅνυμφος and παρθένος, because not married to him.

613. προθῶμαι, “lay out.’' So the Latins used the term “componere’'

614. ὥς ἔχω, “ as Ι am able.”-·rt πάθω, = ‘⁴ dubito quid me fieri opor·
teat, aut quo animo esse debeam et quomodo affecta,” and hence is
nearly = ‘⁶ what can Ι (10 ³ ''

615. Porson joins ἆγείρασα by τε ιο βάψασα ; but it is evident from
μοι πάρεδροι in the next line that she means she is ιο take upon herself
to collect what ornaments she can from the Trojan women in the tents
near her, while her old servant is bringing the lustral water from the
sea. Hence it is better, with Hermann, to join ἀγείρασα by means of -re,
though with a slight irregularity of construction, ιο προθῶμαι.

619. ὦ σχήματ’ οἴκων = “ Ο shapely palaces.” See note on v. 130.

621. ἥδ’ ἐγὼ, “I who am here present.'' See note on v. 53.

623. εἶτα δῆτα, “ and yet, forsooth,'' is sarcastic.

626. τὰ δ’ οὐδέν, “but all these are a mere nothing.”-moes “ no·-
thing but.” See v. 489.

628. ὅτῳ κατ’ ἦμαρ, διο. Hermann quotes Ennius from Cic. de Fin.
ii. 13.

nimium boni est
Cui nihil est mali.

SOENE IV.

Dumna the singing of the choral ode contained in vv, 629—656.
the haudmaiden of Hecuba is supposed to have been to the sea-shore
ιο draw water, and there to have found the body of Polydorus. Now
she comes back bearing it with her, and calls aloud for Hecuba (vv.
657-660). Hecuba recognises the dead body, pronounces Polymestor
to be the murderer (vv. 67 0-7 20), and in her grief forgets that she is
expected attho pyre of her daughter, Polyxena. Agamemnon, accord·
ingly, comes to see the cause of her delay (w. 7 26-7 35) ς is 'intreated
by Hecuba to aid her in her schemes of vengeance (vv. 7 49-845); and
at length consents on condition that his consent is not made known,
and that he is not asked ιο co-operate actively (vv. 850—863). She
then explains that she requires no aid but that of her fellow captive·
women; and Agamemnon returns to the camp, while Hecuba retires to
her tent ιο mature her plans against Polymestor.

This portion of the play forms the third episode (ἐπεισόδιον), as being
the part inserted between the third and fourth choral odes.
