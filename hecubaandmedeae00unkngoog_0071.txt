THE HECUBA. 59

Hermann quotes Orest. 1371 and Ion. 461, where ὑπὲρ in this sense is

followed by the genitive⁶

667. μᾶλλον ἢ λέγω, Le. μᾶλλον τάλαινα ἢ λέγω.

668. οὕκέτθ εἶ, βλέπουσα φως, “ you are no longer truly alive, although
you do still see the light.” So Tennyson speaks of,

In more of life true life no more.

678. σπουδὴν ἔχειν, “to be in course of zealous preparation.”—81&
χερός, “at the hands of‚'’ διο.

679. γυμνωθέν. The haudmaid now uncovers the body, in order that
Hecuba may see whose it is.

684. Of the metres of the following lines Hermann writes that he ,
has tried to reduce them to an antistrophic arrangement, as he tried, with
better successa, to reduce the rhapsodies of Hecuba and Pol ena at the
beginning of the play. In this case, however, he gives up is attempt:
“Nam et violentis opus erat mutationibus, nec metra sibi accurate
respondebant, nee descriptiones stropharum ipsas satis planae atque
idoneis causis fultae conficiebantur. Recte scholiastes carmen hoc ad
ἀνομοιόστροφα refert. Est enim querimonia, versibus maxime dochmi-
acis scripta, non certa lege, sed uti vehemens dolor et indignatio
H ecubae ferebat.''

685. κατάρχομαι νόμον. So Eur. Or. 960, κατάρχομαι στεναγμόν. See
Matth. Gr. Gr. ἓ 336. Elsewhere κατάρχομαι generally governs the
gegggehanxetov, “ins ired' by Bacchusf' and hence ‘⁴ frenziedP—-e‘k'
ἀλάστορος, “ by my e ⁶ gemus?

687. ἀρτιμαθὴς κακῶν, “having lately become learned in sorrows.’⁸
See Matt. Gr. Gr. ἐ 344. So in v. 239, καρδίας δηκτήρια. Adjectives
formed from transitive verbs osten govern a genitive of the object.

691. ἁμέρα ἐπισχήσω. The final α of ἁμέρα is shortened before the
initial vowel of the word next to it. The reading of Porsen ἀδάκρυτος.
ἀστένακτος will not suan. — hccxho'eq = παύσει με, i.e. “from the
griefs that are overwhelming me.'’ If we read with some editors
ἀστένακτον ἀδάκρυτον, these adjectives must be taken proleptically. See
Matt. (5446, note 2, who quotes AEsch. Ag. 1247,

εὔφημον, ὦ τάλαινα, κοίμησον στόμα

i.e., κοίμησον στόμα ὥστε εὔφημον εἶναι. So Virg. AEn. i. 69, “ submersas

obrue puppes.”
696. θνήσκεις ..--. τέθνηκας. See v. 773, θνήσκει δὲ πρὸς τοῦς

698. κνρῶ generally governs a gen. or dat. 3 but see Matth. Gr. Gr. 328,
obs„ where other instances are quoted, where the accusative occurs.

703. Hermann alters Porson’s reming of ἐνύπνιον into ἔνυπνον, and
οὔ με παρέβα into οὐδὲ παρέβα με, in order to make the verses what they
‚ ought to be, dochmiacs.

7 04. This verse has been pronounced by almost all the editors not
to be wanned. Paley, however, by reading εἰσεῖδον instead of ἐσεῖδον,
and ἀμφὶ τέκνον instead of ἀμφί σ’ ὣ τέκνον, for the former of which
alterations there is manuscri t authority, has succeeded in producing a
dochmiac verse. The mascxfiine ὄντα will then agree with the sense of
τέκνον, instead of with its ordinary gender; but this is not unusual
either in Greek or Latin.

708. ὀνειρόφρων, “since you are a divinet of dreams.”
