60 N oms ΟΝ

711. ἵνα refers to Θρῄκη understood in Θρῄκιος, οι· == ‘⁴ with whom ς ”
though Pflugk does not think that it can possibly refer to a person.

713. ἔχῃ. Some MSS. have ἔχοι· in consequence of the preceding
ἔκτανε. For the reason why the subjunctive is used, however, see note
on v. 1245.

7 24. ἀλλὰ . . . γὰρ. The construction will be seen by altering the
’ order thus ε ἀλλὰ τούνθένδε σιγῶμεν, φίλαι· εἷσορῶ γὰρ τοῦδε, κ.τ.λ.
Hence m} .’ . . γὰρ = ἀλλ’ {neh—rofi& = “ here,’' or “ hither.” See
note on v. 3.

725. Ἀγαμέμνονος δέμας, “Agamemnon's stately form.’' See note on
vv. 619 and 130.

726. “Parum scite Euripides regem ipsum venientem, ut arcessat
Hecubam, fecit.” Herm. But the character attributed to Agamemnon
in this play is exceedingly gentle and sympathetic, and· comparatively
careless of outside dignity.

727. ἐφ’ οἷσπερ, “ on the conditions which‚'’ διο. .

732. ἐστὶν καλῶς is more commonly καλῶς ἔχει. See Matth. Gr. Gr.
ξ 309, c. for examples of the adverb with the substantive verb instead
of an adjective.

734. θανόντα Τρώων. Agamemnon recognises Polydorus to be a .

Trojan from his dress which is still on him—ot γὰρ Ἀργείων, i.e. αὐτὸν
εῖναι will depend on ἀγγέλλουσι.

736. δύστηνε refers to Polydorus5 the meaning of the whole assage
being, δύστηνε Πολύδωρε, ἐμαυτὴν γὰρ δύστηνον λέγω, λέγουσα σὲ δ τηνον,
Ἑκάβη δύστηνος τί δράσω ;-Ἐκάβη is nom. “What shall 1, the wretched
Hecuba, do 3 ’' as is seen by the person of the verb δράσω. See Her·
·mann's excellent note on the passage. All this speech of Hecuba’s,
and the two or three speeches that follow will be seen to be muttered
by Hecuba to herself, not addressed to Agamemnon.

739. προσώπῳ, κ.τ.λ., “ having turned your back upon me,'' lit. “ upon
m face.’'

3742. Hermann edits ἄλγος ἄν προσθείμεθ ἄν, adding “ Geminatum ἃς
etiam duplicem in sententia notionem sibi postulat. At ea inest in
verbis, et quidem in praepositione πρός, quoe facit ut sensus sit, καὶ πρὸς
ἂν ἀλγήσαιμεν dv? But the· meaning of this is, as Paley remarks, not
very clear; and it is at least doubtful, whether ἄν qualifies other parts
of speech than verbs and participles.

δ 745.έπρὸς τὸ δυσμενές. See note on v. 406.-μᾶλλον qualifies πρὸς τὸ
υσμεν ς.

748. ἐς ταύτὸν ἥκεις, i. e. ἐμοί, “you have come to the same conclu·
sion as Ῑ.”-οὐδ’ ἐγὼ κλύειν, i. e. βούλομαι.-ταύτὸν. See note on v. 295.

752. τῶνδε γουνάτων. Verbs of praying are followed by a genitive
·of that for the sake of which the entreaty is made. See Matth. 5 372.

755. ἐλεύθερον αἰῶνα θέσθαι, “to gain thyself ἒτοθᾶοω.”-ῥᾴδιον γάρ
ἐστί σοι, “ whyl that is easy for you,” i. e. “ Ask for your freedom and
Ι will give it you.'' Pflugk supposes that what Agamemnon means is
that, if she wishes to be free, she can easily be so by committing
suicide3 much as Shakspeare, though not in the same spirit, says ε

who would fardels bear
'I'o toil and sweat under a weary life,

When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkinl
