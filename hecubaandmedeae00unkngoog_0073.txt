'1⁸11ss HECUBA. 61 ·

But such advice does not accord either with the character attributed
to Agamemnon in the play, or with Hecuba's answer in the next two

lines. So, too, the Oxf. Ed. says.
759. οὐδέν τι τούτων, i. e. μαστεύω, supplied from v. 754, and imfflied

in v. 758.

760. In order to preserve the στιχομυθία, Hermann supposes a line
left out before this one, containing Agamemnon’s answer to what
Hecuba says in v. 759. This supposition would also account for the
rapid change of topic in V. 760, and take away the appearance of
abruptness from ita—05, “over whom,'' lit. “ down on whom‚'' is
governed by the preposition in καταστάζω.

766. ἀνόνητά γε, “yes, this one whom you see, but uselessly, as it
would seem.''

765. ὀρρωδῶν werva- ὀρρωδῶν μὴ θάνοι. So Eur. Ion. 1564, θανεῖν
σε δε σας.

771. Πολυμήστωρ is attracted into the relative clause, instead of
being in the principa] clause, and in the acc. in apposition to ἄνδρα. See
Matth. Gr. Gr. ἓ 474, b.

773. τοῦτ-τίνος.

776. τοιαῦτ’, “just so.”

7 82. θαλασσόπληκτον, “ to wander on the sea,” is used proleptically.
See Matth. Gr. Gr. ἓ 446, x. obs. 2, and note on v. 499. So Soph. OEd.
Tyr. 1411, θαλάσσιον ἑκρίψατε, i. e. εἰς θάλασσαν. See also v. 797.

786. εἰ μὴ. δια, “ unless you were to name misfortune herself.'' Por-
son quotes from Cicero Tusc. Disp. iv. 31, “ Fortunam ipsam anteibo

fortunis meis.”
787. ὦνπερ οὕνεκαεοῦνεκα. But οὕνεκα was so often used that its

derivation from οὗ ἕνεκα fell out of sight, and it was used, as here, for the
διαίὲἒὶῗ {uzzand ἄν, “ Ι will submit.” The optative softens the future,
since ‘⁴ Attici omnia amant dubitantius loqui.” So in Soph. Phil. 1302,
οὐκ ἂν μεθείην stands in answer to αέθες με, πρὸς θεῶν, χεῖρα, φίλτατον

τέκνον. ,
7 94·5. Hermann reads:

ξενίας τ’ ἀριθμῷ πρῶτα τῶν ἐμῶν φίλων
τυχὼν ὅσων δεῖ καὶ λαβὼν προθυμίαν.

Thus taking πρῶτα adverbially, and reading προθυμίαν for προμηθίαν, he
translates “in the number of my guest-friends having obtained first of
all my friends what is right, and having received so much kindness.”
Even with these alterations the repetition of τυχὼν, and the use of
ξενίας ἀριθμῷ for ἐν τῷ τῶν ξένων ἀριθμῷ are very harsh. In the common
text προμηθίαν must mean ‘⁴ respect, attention,'’ and πρῶτα must be put
for τὰ πρῶτα, i. e. πρῶτος. The article, however, cannot properly be
omitted. See, for instance, Herod. vi. 100. Αἶσχίνης ὁ Νόθωνος ἐὼν τῶν
Ἐρετριέων τὰ πρῶτα, and other passages quoted by Matth. Gr. Gr. §
438. For these reasons most editors have declared these two lines to
be spurious, and enclosed them in brackets.

796. τύμβου δ’ εἰ, ecana. is a short way of expressing τύμβου δ’, ει '

κτανεῖν ἐβούλετο, οὗ δέον ἀποστερῆσαι, οὐκ ἠξίωσεν. Pflugk.

797. ἀφῆκε πόντιον. See note on v. 7 82.
799. ὅ κείνων κρατῶν νόμος, i. e. “The supreme Fater to whom Gods
