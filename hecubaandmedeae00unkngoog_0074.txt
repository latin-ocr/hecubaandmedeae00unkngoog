and men alike, according ιο the Greek· notien, were subject. By the
help of this notion they were able to retain, what their polytheism
often threatened to rob them of, the belief that the universe was not
subject merely ιο the individual caprice of Gods with all the passione
ο men.

800. νόμῳ, “through the conception of lud—‘roim θεοὺς ἦγούμεθοεε
τοὺς θεοὺς ἡγούμεθα θεοὺς εἶναι.

801. νόμῳ must be supplied again here, the -meaning being that “it is
through this supreme unchanging law that our notione of the unchange-
able difference between right and wrong spring up, and form the prac-
tical guide of life.’' “

802. ὅς, i. ο. νόμος.

804. econ is a monosyllable Ιιοτα-φέρειν, “ to carry off.”

gl 807. &roca-afleta “ having stood a little way off, in order, as it were,
ιο get *the right point of view.” Schaefer quotes Lucian Τ. ii. p. 491,
ἢν μὲν πάνυ ἐγγύθεν σκοπῶμέν τι καὶ ὑπὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμοῖν αὐτῶν, οὐδὲν
ἀκριβὲς διαγιγνώσκομεν· ἣν δὲ ἀποστάντες ἐκ τοῦ συμμέτρου διαστήματος
ἴδωμεν, ἅπαντα, σαφῶς καταφαίνεται τὰ εὖ καὶ τὰ μὴ οὕτως ἔχοντα.

812. ποῖ μ’ ὑπεξάγεις πόδα, “ whither do you go to avoid me ;”
ὑπεξάγεις πόδα being equivalent to φεύγεις used transitively, and ποῖ,
being used. in a constructio proeqmaw, introduces the idea of motion.
Hermann quotes for a similar construction, Soph. OEd. Col. 113,

καὶ σύ μ’ ἐξ ὁδοῦ πόδα
κρύψον κατ’ ἄλσος,

i. e. “tuum pedem in luco occulta me abducens: i. ο. abduc me in
lucum sic, ut te non videant qui adveniunt.”

817. οὐδέν τι μᾶλλον, “not a whit the more on that accountP-{s
τέλος . . . μανθάνειν, “ιο learn ιο perfection.”

818. μισθοὺς διδόντες. This practice, common enough in the days of
Euripides, sounds oddly in the mouth of Hecuba-td ἦν, “in which
case it would have been possib1e;” ἵνα and ὥς, with past indicative
tenses, meaning that which might have happened under different cir·
cumstances. See Matth. Gr. Gr. ξ 619.

820. ἐλπίσαι. This form for the aorist optative is very rare in Attio
poe . Pflugk quotes ἂποπτύσαιεν from Hel. 75 and κτίσαι from
Supp . 621. The latter, however-,is from a choral part of the play.

822. ἐπ’ αἰσχροῖς, “for base (i. ο.. menial) purposes.”

824. wi> λόγου depende on τόδοι “ this portion of my speeeh.”

827. Κασάνδραν. Hermann proposes Κασάνδρα, on the ground that
the passage must mally mean Kacdudpulw φοιβάδα καλοῦσι. Φρύγες, as Aga·
memnon would certainly not require to be reminded that the Phrygiam
called his concubine Cassandra, though the name ἦ φοιβὰς might not
be so familiar ιο him.

830. χάριν τίνα, “ what return for,” dcc.

831-832. These lines are with reason suspected to be spurious,
and are consequently enclosed in brackets by Pflugk and Dindorf, and
rejected b Matth, and Herm.

835. δρ ezs= καλῶς δράσεις. “In doing good· to him, you will do
good to one who is your relation ;” though the construction is rather
