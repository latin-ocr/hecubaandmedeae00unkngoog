836. εἰ, “ would that? For the sentiment see Sir Walter Scott'
poem on the massacre of Glencoe: -

Long have my harp's best notes been gone,
Few are its stringe, and faint their tone,
They can but sound in desert lone

Their gwy-hair'd master’s misery.
Were eaoh grey hair a minstrel string,
Each chord should imprecatione fling,
'riu startled Scotland loud should ring,

“ Revenge for blood and treachery l’'

8:38. Δαιδάλου. Daedalus made such improvements in sculpture that
he was reputed to be able to endow his statues with the power of loco-
motion, and automata were hence called Δαιδάλεα ἀγάλματα. Pflugk

uotes Diodorus Siculus, iv. 76, as to his having made some so life-like,
ἓστε δοκεῖν τὸ κατασκευασθὲν ἔμψυχον ζῶον.

839. ἔχοιτο, “ might eling t0.’'

843, ἀλλ’ ὅμως, i. e. παράσχες.

847. τὰς {va-ynas— . . . διώρισαν, mm. ‘⁴ The laws of right and wrong·

851. From the position of τε-τε, coupling together ἔχειν and
δόξαιμι, the latter clause ought to be ὥστε μὴ δόξαι με, or the former
τε should be placed immediately after φανείη, thus coupling φανείη
{ad δόξαιμι. Some MSS. have φανείην, which suits well with

857. ἔστιν ἢ, “in a certain respect‚'' is like ἔστιν ὅπου, ἔσο-ιν ὅπη, and
similar phrases. See Matth. Gr. Gr. ξ 482, obs, 2.

matter of private feeling in which they have no concern.’'

863. Ἀχαιοῖς, ‘⁶ at the hands of the Greeks.” See note on v. 535.

864-867. Somewhat similar in sentiment are Shakspeare's noble
lines in Henry V. act iv. sc. 1, beginning:

Ο hard condition ί twin-born with grentam,
Subject to the breath of every scol, whose sense
No more can feel but his own wringingl

867. εἴργουσι χρῆσθαι μὴ = εἴργουσι μὴ χρῆσθαι, “ deterrent quominus
matur ,·’' the negative being redundant, as usual, after verbs of pre-

waiam, and translates, “ constrain him to (ὥστε) adopt a manner not
after his judgment‚”

870. ξυνισθι, “ consent.’'
873. πάσχοντος . . . ola πείσεται. This kind of repetition is often used
