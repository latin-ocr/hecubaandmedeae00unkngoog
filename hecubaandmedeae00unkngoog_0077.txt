Tm: HEC ΗΒΑ. 65

912. κηλῖδα is the acc. of cognate signification after κατακέχρωσαι.

915. ἐκ δείπνων, “ directly after supper.” So ea: coena, in Latin.

917. ἀπὸ is here redundant, as καταπαύσας governs the genitive.—
καταπαύσας = καταπαυσέμενος.

920. ξυστὸν δ’ ἐπὶ πασσάλῳ, “ now his spear was on its peg,” must be

guppoised ἕο be ingertfleld pertenthetically, as ὁρῶν iu the next line refers
ac οπ casm e e e ore.

921. ναύταν ὅμιλον, “ the sailor crowd.”

926. ἆτέρμονας αὐγὰς, “ countless rays.’' So Liddell and Scott. But
Pflugk with the Scholiast makes ἆτέρμοναςεκυκλοτερεῒςς which seems
far-fetched and prosy.

927. ἐπιδέμνιος. Porson reads ἐπιδέμνιον . . . εὐνάν, which would-
mean “ a conch on the bed,'’ i.e. a “ cushioned bed. ” But there is no
nezd of {lae change, there being an equal amount of pleonasm with
eit er re in .

931. τὰν Ἰελιάδα σκοπιὰν. Pflugk quotes the well-known Homeris
phrase Ἴλιος ἠνεμόεσσα.

9:34. Δωρὶς ὡς κόρα. 'The Spartan maidens were always scantily
clothed„ See Androm. 595, sqq.

οὐδ’ ἃν εἰ βούλοιτό τις
σώφρων ’γένοιτο Σπαρτιατίδων κόρη,
αἳ ξὺν νέοισιν ἐξερημοῦσαι δόμους
’γυμνοῖσι μηροῖς καὶ πέπλοις ἀνειμένοις
δρόμους παλαίστρας τ’ οὐκ ἀνασχετοὺς ἐμοὶ
κοινὰς ἔχουσι.

935. προσίζουσ) οὐκ ἤνυσα, “ effected nothing by sitting as a suppliaut
before ’ &c-

940? πόδα, “ the sheet of the sai1.’' Paley suggests that both mean·
ings of the word πόδα are combined, as return homeward is spoken of.
-ἆπὺ . . . . ὥρισεν -- ἆφῶρισεν by tmesis.

942. ἀπεῖπον ἄλγει, “ Ι gave up, fainted, under my sorrows.’'

94 5. αἰνόπαριν, “ill-omened Paris.'’ So Paris is called Δύσπαρις, II.
iii. 39. See note on v. 442.

947. πατρῴας shortens its final syllable before the succeeding vowel.

See note on v. 82. There is therefore no necessity to alter it, with
Dindorf, into πατρίας.

- ‚948. ’γάμος οὔ γάμος. So S. Paul, Gal. i. 6, εἷς ἕτερον εὐαγγέλιον, δ
οωὲὶέῗῖπῖγῖίζοι is in the optative to express a wish.

SCENE V.

Pontus'roa enters, affecting sympathy with Hecuba in her missor·
tunes (vv, 953-967). Hecuba aske him to excuse her not venturing
to look him in the face in her slavish condition; makes enquiries about
Polydorus, to display the ruthlessness of Polymestor's character, and
at last tempts him into her tent by telling him that, besides treasurcs
hidden underground in Troy, she has some with her, which she has
hitherto saved from the eyes of the Greeks (vv. 968-1022).
