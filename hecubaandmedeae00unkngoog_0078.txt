The Chorus then, being left alone on the stage, utters a short
dochmiac ode , full of indignation at the inhumanity of Polymestor

and anticipatione of summary vengeance coming down immediater
upon him (vv. 1023—1034).

The scene would be called by the Greeks the fourth episode, as

. being inserted between the fourth and fifth choral songs.

956. εὐδοξία, “fair fame.'’

958. φύρουσι δ’ αὐτὰ. So ἔφυρον εἰκῆ πάντα. AEsch. Prom. Vino. 450
959. &zv‘Ws‘b “in consequence of our ignorance of what is going to
ιη08611.“·ῗιι·.ροιιιό·ιι··ιόντ·’ οὐδὲν ἐς πρόσθεν κακῶν, “in no ways advancing to

get over our woes.”-t³s πρόσθεν κακῶνε ἐς τὺ πρόσθεν τῶν κακῶν. See
Matth. Gr. Gr. ἒ 340.

963. τυγχάνω--ἑτύγχανοκ

966. ἐς ταῦτον συμπίτνει, “ falls in with me (through having arrived),
at the same place,” or “falls in with me to persuade me to carry out
the same object I had in view myself.’' So Oxf. ed.

968. αϊροντι, i. e. πόδα, “lifting my foot,'’ i. e. “ setting out.'’

971. τυγχάνουσα should be in the accusative to agree with the με in
αἰδώς μ’ ἔχει; but it is put in the nom. to agree with the verb αἰδοῦμαι
contained in αἰδώς μ’ ἔχει.

972. ὀρθαῖς κόραις ὁρᾶν, “ to look straight at you.” So the Latius used
rectus. See Cic. Rab. Post. 17, “Hie vos aliud nihil orat, nisi ut
rectis oculis hanc urbem sibi intueri liceat-’⁸

974. ἄλλως δὲ, “ besides.”

976. τίς χρεία σ’ ἐμοῦ. As χρεία εστί is almost equivalent to χρὴ, it
sometimes, like χρὴ, is followed by an accusative3 asin Hom. 11. xi.
605, τί δέ σε χρεὼ ἐμεῖο. See Matth. 414, obs. 2.

977. τί χρῆμαεδιὰ τί χρῆμας “whereforez ”-ἐπέμψω, “have you
sent for.‘' In this sense μετεπέμψω would be more usual.

984. μὴ πράσσουσιν. In prose the article τοῖς would be prefixed.

989. τούκείνου μέρος, “ as far as he is concerned.”

990. Notice the consummate irony in this line.

992. τῆσδε, “ me who am here speaking to you.''

995. The double meaning should be noted. Polymestor chuckles, as
he reflecte how very “ safe ” the treasure is.

997. ὀναίμην τοῦ παρόντος, “may I enjoy what is my own;” with
the concealed meaning, perhaps, of “may I enjoy what is in my

ower.
-p 1000. ἔστω φιληθεὶς cannot have Polydorus forits subject, from the
drift of the two previous lines. The subject must be λόγος supplied
from λόγῳ in the line before ; and thus the meaning will be, as
Schaefer translates it, “ Quae tibi dicam, tanto studio accipe, quanto
studio ego te nunc amo ε ” a sentence which will bear a double mean·
Eg, one 'ftffl toti¹ {atter-{hm the tehar- ἓέἔοΙγῗεεὺἙ, and anotggr ἒαΒ οὲ

esmo aem u o ecua. ermannreso·
φιληθεῐίς, from conjecture? ffissking ἔστι agree with κατώρυχες, which, is
iteelf as harsh as the want of a verb for κατώρυχες to agree with3 a
want which is accounted for by the broken nature of the sentence
caused by constant interpellation.

1007. τῇδε, “ in this respect.”

1008. Ἀθάνας. This ,Dorio form is ‚always used by the tragediam.
