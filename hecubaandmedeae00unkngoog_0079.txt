'mn ΗΕοοΒΑ. ’ 67

“ Attici dieunt Αθάνα, δαρὸς, ἕκατι, κυναγὸς, ποδαγὸς, λοχαγὸς, ξεναγὸς,
staats, per α, non per η.” Porson ad. Orest. v. 26. So Ionisms are
allowed in certain words. Thus ξεῖνος is often used for ξένος, μοῦνος for
μόνος, ’γούνατα for γόνατα, κοῦρος for κόρος, δουρὶ for δορὶ. (See Porson’s
preface to Hecuba, p. 9, Scholefield’s edition.) So in v. ’ἴ 5 of this play
Πολυξείνῳ-ἵνα, “ where.”

1013. “ Where pray‘l Have you got it about you in your garments,
or have you hidden it and got it somewhere else'3” In the latter
clause ἔχεις is of course emphatic, and means more than “ Have
you hidden it ν’ Porson alters ἢ into ἣ, i.e. num, making the question
a single one. He calls the common reading leve vitium. But there
seems not to be sufficient ground for any chang03 the meaning of ἢ
suiting the context better than that of ἥ. “ Non erat·,’' says Hermann,
“ cur mutaretur ἥ. Hoc-conjicientis, ἦ gravius interrogantis est.''

1017. κάρσένων ἐρημίας “ and are there no men there? '’

1020. πόδα. See note on v. 940.

1021. ὧν σε δεῖ. For this construction of the genitive and accusative
after δεῖ, compare Eur. Her. Fur. 117 3.

ἔιτι δεῖ, γε ον,
ἢ χειρὸς ὑμᾶς τῆς ἐμῆς ἢ συ χων.

It is worth while to notice the terrible double meaning hidden under
the apparently harmless phrases rein-a πράξας ὧν σε δεῖ and στείχῃς
οὗπερ τὸν ἐμὸν ᾤκισᾳς γόνον.

1025-1034. These verses are dochmiacs, with the exception of v.
1031, which is a common iambic trimeter.

1025. ἆλίμενονε “ harbourless,'' or ‘⁸ hard to extricato one’s self
from,” according as ἄντλον is taken to mean “ the sea,” or “ the hold of
a ship.”

1026. λέχριος, “slantingly,” because ⁴of the pitching of the ship,
which being itself out of the perpendicular, would throw a man off his
balance into the same position. Pflugk quotes Virg. AEn. i. 104,

Franguntur remi3 tum prora avertit et undis
Dat latus; insequitur cumulo praeruptus aquae mons.

-ἑκπέσ-ῃ. This use of the subjunctive after ὡς to express reference to
something usually happening, is not to be found among the tragedians
except in this instance. In Homer, however, it is common enough;
as 11. ix. 477, ὡσείτε πατὴρ ὅν παῖδα φιλήσῃ. See Matth. Gr. (θη-,ξ
521, obs. 3. Scholefield, however, would read the future ἑκπεσεΐ, and
translate the whole passage :- ut qui in mare importuoswm inciderit, tu
vita excides. Pflugk also remarks, in favour of Scholefield’s reading,
that some MSS. have ἐκκαῇ-φίλας καρδίας depende on ἐκπέσῃ.

1028. ἆμέρσας βίον. Since ἆμέρδειν governs two accusativa, we may
supply Πολύδωρον as the acc. of the person, and translate: “ because
you deprived Polydorus of life.'’ Or ἀμέρσας may be taken in a middle
sense with the acc. of the thing alone, and the meaning be simply:
“ having lost thy life.'' Hermann refers βίον to καρδίαν understood from
the line before, and translates: “vitam ea privans.'’ Nono of the
renderings are very satisfactory, as in the one case the ellipsis ot
Πολύδωρον is harsh, and in the others we have a weak tautology.—
τὸ γὰρ ὑπέγγνον . . . . κακόν, “ for destructive, destructive is the evil
