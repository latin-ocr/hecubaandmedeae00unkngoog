Tun screams of Polymestor's children as they are being killed by
Hecuba and the Trojan women with her, are heard issuing from the tent.
Then there is the noise of a scuffie, and afterwards the groans of Poly·
mestor, as he laments the destruction of his eyesight and the death of
his children. The women then, having let Polymestor go, escape out
of tbe tent, with Hecuba at their head, in order to avoid the vengeance
of the maddened Polymestor, who soon after follows them upon the
stage,·groping and ’stumbling in his blindness, with his eye-balls stream· ,

to his assistance.

Agamemnon, hearing Polymestor’s eries for help, enters to know
the cause. Polymesto‘r explains what has been done to him, and tries
to justify his conduct to Polydorus. Hecuba answers his statements,
and is declared by Agamemnon to have inflicted on Polymestor no
more than he deserves. Polymestor, in his rage and despair, reveals
what has been told him by a Thracian,seer about the fates of Hecuba
and Agamemnon, and Cassandra, and the play ends heavily with a
declaration made by the Chorus that the awards of destiny are inex-
plicable, and not to be controlled.

This scene would be termed by the Greeks the exode (ἔξοδος), as being
the one at the end of which the Chorus would make its exit from the
stage.
