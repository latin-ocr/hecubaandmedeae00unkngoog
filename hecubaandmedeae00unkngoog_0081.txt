THE HECUBA. 69

tion, asseems to be the case sometimes where βούλει ον’βούλεσθε is

inserted in the middle of the sentence (see Matth. Gr. Gr. ἓ 516, iii.), or

else it is governed by ἵνα understood. So the verb is put in the sub-

{uactive in Latin without a conjunction after velle, cavere, δια-ἀκμὴ,
‘ e crisis.”

1047. ἧ γὰρ καθεῖλες Θρῇκα καὶ κρατεῖς ξένου = ἦ ’γὰρ καθεῖλες Θρῇκα

’ ξένον, καὶ κρατεῖς αὐτοῦς see Matth. ξ 428. 2.

1050. τυφλῷ· ποδί. With a similar transference to one partos the
body of what more properly belongs to the other, Burns speaks of
“ The weeping blood of woman’s heart.''

1055. θυμῷ is the dative of the manner, and ζέοντι, “ because he is
boiling over,” agrees with Θρῃκί.

1056. The verses in which Polymestor gives utterance to his outraged
'feelings are naturally very irregular, and such as are calculated to
¹express great mental perturbation. They are mostly either irregular-
anapaests like those used by Hecuba and Polyxena (vv. 59—99 and
155-215) or dochmiacs. Hermann has attempted to reduce them to
regularity and correspondence, but has found it only possible to do so
by alterations without MSS. authority.

1057. κέλσω, i. e. ἐμαυτόν, by a metaphor taken from a ship, νῆα
κέλσαι being = navem appellere. Note that the future ends in σω,
though the verb is of the liquid conjugation. So ὅρω makes ὅρσω.

1058. βάσιν is governed by τιθέμενος. “ Plauting the step of a four-
footed mountain wild·beast on my hand (as well as on my feet),'' i. e.
“ walking on all-fours like a wild beast.” Pflugk, however, seeing that
the meaning is equivalent to θηρὸς δίκην βάσιν τιθέμενος (i. e. βαίνων),
proposes to insert βόσιν twice, once to govern θηρὸς, with the mean·
ing of θηρὸς δίκην, and then again after τιθέμενος, so that the

,meaning would be “after the step of (i. e. like) a wild beast, placing
it on '’ &c-

’ 1059. This line may be scanned as an irregular anapaest by consider·
ing the four short syllables of τιθέμενος as equivalent to a spondee.
See notes on vv. 62 and 78.-ἑπὶ χεῖρα. One would hardly expect the
accusative after the preposition ἐπὶ, as there is no mark of motion.——1ear'
ἴχνος may possibly be coupled with ἐπὶ χεῖρα, and mean “and on my

feet.” But it should more probably be taken to mean, as it usually
would, “on their traek.’'

1060. ποίαν, i.e. ὁδόν 3 “ Which path shall I change‘l'' i. e. “ Which
paths shall 1 successively try 'l’'

1062. This line, as Hermann remarks, consists ofa paeon primus (for
a cretio) anda dochmius.

1063. This line is a dochmiac restored by Hermann, who altered it

tfrom Porson’s reading τάλαιναι, τάλαιναι, κ.τ.λ.

1065. μυχῶν depende on ποῗ, an adverb of place.

1067. This line would be anapoestic if the second syllable in τυφλὸν
could be made long by position. Hence Paley proposes to read τυφλόν
θ’. . . . ἀπαλλάξαις. τυφλον must be joined with φέγγος. The two words
together are equivalent to “ darkness,'' “blindness’' Scholeiield notes

Polymestor naturally prays for light to the sun, as the source of light.
So Milton in his blindness addresses first the light from which he is cut
off, and then that which it typifies:
