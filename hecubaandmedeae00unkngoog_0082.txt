Hail, holy ⁴light, effigi-ing of hessven's first born.

⁴* ⁴* ’ ⁴* ⁴* thou
Revisitst not these eyes, that roll in vain
'l'o find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn ς
So thick a drop serene hath quenched their orbs,
Or dim suffusion veiled.
So much the rather, thou celestial Light l
Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers
Irradiate; there plant eyes, all mist from thence
Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell
Of things invisible to mortal sight.

τάνδε is perhapsbetter than τᾶνδε, Person’s reading. For its meaning

see note on v. 53.
1070. ἐτι-ᾄξας is here used transitively. For other. instances see

Matth. Gr. Gr. ἓ 423.

1071. ὀστέων must be ronounoed as a dissyllable. -

1072. θοίναν . . . τιθ μενος, “ providing for myself a wild beasts'
feast.’' τιθέμενος is a resolved spondee. See note on v. 1059.

1073. ἀρνύμενος λώβαν, “ eaming revenge.''

107 4. This line is a dochmiac. Hence ἰὼ must be pronounced as a
monosyllabis, as in v. 1033.-ἆντι’ποινα is in apposition with λώβαν, 'or
rather perhaps with the general sense of the two previous linea-2& is
changed by Hermann into ὦ metri cauam but, as Paley points out here
and at v. 1033, without reason.

1076. Polymestor, far keener at discerning wickedness in others
than in himself, suspects that the Furios, who killed his children, will,

. if he leaves them unguarded, tear them limb from limb in Bacchanal

ὥδωσα-διαμῶσαι, discerpendos. For the use of the infinitivo active
where the Latins would use the gerundive, see Matth. Gr. Gr. ἓ 535,
obs, See also the Greek construction imitated in Horace Ι. od. xxvi. 2,

tristitiam et metus
Tradam protervis in mare Creticum
Portare ventis,

where portare stands for portamdos.
1077, 1078. These lines are, by Hermann's transposition of τε from

the place in which it stands in the MSS„ reduced to three dochmii,
with a cretic at the end. In this case οὔρεὶαν must be pronounced with
its penultima short. Paley quotes 'Pi-cad, 533, and Androm. 284, as other
instanees. So γεραιᾶς in v. 63, where see the note. Hermann proposes
to read σφακτὰ κυσίν τες and wishes to insert an epithet ἄναγνον· after
ἀνήμερον to change v.. 1078 into a dochmiac dimeter. In that case
cpfflgnwssdffgoeffeeessssh {Zizais} ssdglgy knee'' (in order to sit down
and rest)? So v. 1150, κάμψας γόνυ.

1080. This line is a cretio tetrameter, the third cretio being resolved
into a paeon primus. ναῦς ὅπως, κ.τ.λ. = “ contracting sail (i. e. eeasing
to wander away from my children) like a ships—ntem: must here
mean not “the cablcs,'' but “ the sheets,'' as Pflugk observes 3 unless
we suppose with Paley, that it depends on some such word as δεθεὶοο

understood.
