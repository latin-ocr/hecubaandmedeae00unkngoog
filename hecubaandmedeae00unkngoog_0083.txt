THE HECUBA . 71

1083 is an iambic tripodis, and the next line a dochmius. In order
to restore the dochmiac dimeter, which probably was written by the
poet, Paley proposes to read μοι or μου for ἐμῶν.

1085. σοι, “ to thee‚” not “ by thee,” as the context will show.

1087. ὅστις, “ whoever he be that,’' 800. The line is repeated almost
verbally from v. 722, and for this reason, and. because Polymestor's
sufferings were the consequence of his crimes, and not of the causeless
wrath of some deity, is rejected by Hermann. -

1088-1105. These lines are more irregular in metre than any wc
have yet met with in the play, to reflect the increasing perturbation⁴ot ’
Polymestor‚ as his physical pain and his great loss and inability to
revenge himself impress themselves more and more keenly on his
mind. The verses are an inter-mixture of dochmiacs‚- iambics, cretics‚ &e

1088-1090. There is some difficulty about the metre of these lines.
Pale makes! them two dochmiac dimeters by reading εὕιππόν τ’ ''Aoe-
τε κ ‘mxcv γενος.

1090. Ἄρει κάτοχον. Here the dative is used for the agent instead oi*
the genitive with ὕπο. So the dative of the agent is often used ir
Latin with passive participles, and verbal adjectives.

1094. ἢ οὐδεὶς must be pronounced like a dissyllable. .

1095. γυναῖκες ὥλεσάν με. For the horror felt by warriors at being
killed or wounded by women and children, see J udges viii. 21, ix. 54.

1097. This line, according to Dindorf, is a dochmiac dimeter with e.

v. Ο is troc aic.

1100, 1101. This line is paeonic, with a trochee prefixed. Hermann,
however, on the authority of one of the Scholia-ets, omits αἰθέρα.-
ἆμπτάμενοςεᾶναπτάμενος. For the sentiment Paley compares Med.

1102. This line is dactylic with an unaccented syllable prefixed.

1107. ξυγγνῶστα. The adjective in the predicate is often put in the
plural after the verb εἶναι, instead of being put in the singular. This
is especially the case with verbal adjectives. See Matth. Gr. Gr. ἓ 443.

1108. ἐξαπαλλάξαι, i. e. {aurove-(Ans is an Ionism for ζωῆς. For
other instances see note on v. 1008.

1109. οὐ must be closely connected with ἥσυχος, the two words
