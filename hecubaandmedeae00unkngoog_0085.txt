THE HECUBA. :¹³

(See Smith’s Dict. of Antiq„ Art. Peplum.) Here, however, it is put
for the outer garment of a man. 1

1166. στολίσματος depende on γυμνόν.-διπτύχου στολίσματος, 1.8.
“ his outer garment and his spear.”

1157. ἐκπαγλούμενσιι, “admiringly.”

1160. πῶς δοκεῖς, “how think you‘l’' qualifies γαληνῶν. Translate,
“ After addresses, oh how full of blandishment.”

1161. ποθὲν, “from some place or another.”

f 1111623 κεντοῦσι has for its subject αἱ μὲν to correspond with αἱ δὲ
o owing.

1163. εἴχον. See note on ἔχουσαι at v. 1153.

1165. ἐξανισταίην. The optative is put with the past tenses after
{onjunctions of time, to sig-nify repeated action. See Matth. Gr. Gr.
b 521.

1168. The selfish character of Polymestor comes out in the stronger
feeling he manifeste for the loss of his own eyesight than for the loss
of his children’s livea—rima is in apposition to δείνα, οι· to the mean-
ing of the whole of the rest of the sentence. See Matth. Gr. Gr. ἓ

1172. ἐκ δὲ πηδήσας-ε ἐκπηδήσας δὲ. 888 a stronger instance of
tmesis quoted by Matthiae (Gr. Gr. ἓ 594) from Thuo. iii. 13, μὴ ξὺν
κακῶς ποιεῖν αὐτους μετ’ Ἀθηναίων, ἀλλὰ ξυνελευθεροῦν.

1175. χάριν τὴν σὴν is governed by σπεύδων.

1178. τῶν πρὶν depende on τις.

1179. Person reads from Stobaeus, ἢ νῦν λέγει τις ἢ πάλιν μέλλε
λέγειν. The MSS„ however, read either ἢ νῦν λέγων ἐστί τις ἢ μέλλει
λέγειν, or in one case ἢ νῦν λέγων τίς ἐστίν ἢ μέλλει λέγειν. The last
reading is the one adopted in the text.

1181. “ γὰρ, like the Latin nempe, serves for the explanation of a
preceding proposition, in which was contained a demonstrative pro·
gouln, preparing the way for that which follows.” Matth. Gr. Gr.

1182. The first syllable of ἀεὶ 18 common.-‹5 ἀεὶ ξυντυχὼν, ‘⁴ he
who has from time to time had to do with them ; '’ i. e. ‘⁴ whoever has
had to do with them.” So ὁ ἀεὶ ἄρχων, “the archon for the time
being ;’' “ whoever is archon.’'

1183. τοῖς σαυτοῦ κακοῖς, “ in consequence of your own ills.''

1185. This and the next line are enclosed in brackets by most
editors as spurious or corrupt. The meaning, of* course, is, “Some
women are good, some bad.’' But it is difficult to extract that
meaning. The old Scholiasts obtained a good sense by giving to
ἐπίφθονοι the sense of ἐπαινετοί, a sense, however, which it could not
possess. Pflugk attempts to translate the passage as it stands;
“Some of us, and indeed many, are deserving of hatred3 but others
again are, in consequence of being born women, reckoned among the
undistinguished crowd of the bad ;'' ἀριθμὸς being taken asin Eur.

Ἠοῖ. 997, εἷδὼς μὲν οὐκ ἀριθμὸν ἀλλ’ ἐτητύμως ἄνδῤ ὄντα τὸν σὸν

παῖδα. 8ο Horace’s nos numerus sumus. Schoefer, again, retains the
reading of the MSS„ translating ἐπίφθονοι, invidia premuntur (quum
sint innocentissimae). So too Scholefield. Hermann elegantly pro·
poses ai δ’ ἆντάριθμοι τῶν κακῶν πεφύκαμεν, “ But others again equa}

tho bad in number ;'’ i. e. “there are as many good as there are bad.”
