THE HECUBA. :¹³

(800 Smith’s Dict. of Antiq„ Art. Peplum.) Here, however, it is put

11162. κεντοῦσι 1100 for its subJect αἱ μὲν to coz-respond with αἱ δὲ
fo owing.

1163. ε’ίχον. 800 note on ἔχουσαι at v. 1153.

1165. {taum-rainu. The optative is put with the past tenses after
{onjtlmctions of time, to signify repeated action. See Matth. Gr. Gr.

1168. Τ110 selfish character of Polymestor comes out in the stronger
feeling he manifeste for the loss of his own eyesight than for the loss
of his children’s 11100-πῆμο 10 111 apposition to δείνα, or to the mean-
ing of the whole of the rest of the sentence. 800 Matth. Gr. Gr. g

1172. ἐκ δὲ amoto-as: ἐκπηδήσας δὲ. 800 0 stronger instance of
tmesis quoted b? Matthiae (Gr. Gr. ἓ 594) from Thuc. iii. 13, μὴ ξὺν

1175. χάριν τὴν σὴν 10 governed by σπεύδων.

1178. τῶν πρὶν depende on τις.

1179. Ρο10011 100ἀο from Stobaeus‚ ἢ νῦν λ’ ει τις ἢ πάλιν μέλλε
λέγειν. Τ110 MSS„ however, read either ἢ νῦν {lycon ἐστί τις ἦ μέλλει

λέγειν, or in 0110 case ἢ νῦν λέγων τίς ἐστίν ἢ μέλλει λέγειν. The last
reading is the one adopted in the text.

1183. τοῖς σαυτοῦ κακοῖς, “in consequence of your own 1110.”

1185. This and the next line are enclosed in brackets by most
editors as spurious or corrupt. Τ110 meaning. of course, is, “Some
women are good, some bad.” But it is difficult to extract that
meaning. The old Scholiasta obtained 0 good sense by giving to
ἐπίφθονοι the sense of ἐπαινετοί, 0 001100, however, which it could not
possess. Pflugk attempts to translate the passage as it stands;
“Some of us, and indeed many, are deserving of hatred; but others
again are, in consequence of being born women, reckoned among the
undistinguished crowd of the bad ;” ἀριθμὸς being taken asin Eur.
‘Heu 997, εἰδὼς μὲν οὐκ ἀριθμὸν ἀλλ’ ἐτητύμως ἄνδῤ ὄντα τὸν σὺν
παῖδα. So Horace's nos numemoe sumus. Schoefer, again, retains the
reading of the MSS„ translating ἐπίφθονοι, invidia premuntur (quum
sint innocentissimae). 80 too Scholefield. Hermann elegantly pro-
