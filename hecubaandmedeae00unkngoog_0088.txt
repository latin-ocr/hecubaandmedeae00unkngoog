⁷4 ROTES ΟΝ

1189. ἔδρασε is put in the singular, though referring to the plural
noun ἀνθρώποισι, because the one man, Polymestor, is now principally
thought of. The change of number from singular to plural, and viee
versa, is common in Greek. See Matth. Gr. Gr. ἓ 293, who quotes Eur.

Suppl. 437.

ἔστιν δ’ ἐνισπεῖν τοῖσιν ἀσθενεστέροις
τὸν εὐτυχοῦντα ταῦθ’ ὅταν κλύῃ κακῶς

i· e. ὁ ἀσθενέστερος. ·

1192. οἱ τάδ’ ἠκριβωκότες, i. e. “those who have reduced the art of
making the worse appear the better reason to a science.”

1194. ἀπώλοντο, “are wont to perish.” Here the aorist is used to
express repeated action. See note on v. 598.

1195. τὸ μὲν σὺν, i.e. “ what 1 (Hecuba) have to say to thee (Aga-
πλεκτικαὶ-φροιμίοις, “ by way of prelude.”

1196. τόνδε, i. e. Polymestor.

1197. ὅς φὴς. The second person is used, where from the form
of the previous line we might have expected the third, because
now Hecuba turns to Polymestor‚ and addresses him pax-nonaum·—
ἀπαλλάσσων -- ἆπαλλάξων.-διπλοῦν, soe vv. 1138—1141.

1199. οὔποτ’ ἃν. As οὐ is followed by οὔτε, and the antithesis of
οὗ γένοιτ’ ἂν. . . ,οὔτ’ ἂν δύναιτο is by no means a forcible one, Her-
mann proposes ιο read, in accordance with a bint of the Soholiast,

πρῶτα ποῦ πότ’ ἂν φίλον
τὸ βάρβῖον γένοιτ’ ἃν Ἕλλησιν *ytres-5
οὔτᾶν δ αιτο.

It will be noticed that there is a¹ doubling oi ἂν in this passage,
though without much difference of meaning, except perhaps a slight
strengthening of expression. See Matth. Gr. Gr. S 600. With regard
to the sentiment uttered by Hecuba as ιο the inextinguishable hatred
burning between the Greeks and those whom they called barbarians,
we see in it a proof how little before the spread of Christianity the
feeling that “ God hath made of one blood all nations of men’ had
penetrated men’s minds, and made them think themselves capable of
sympathy or amalgamation.

1203. τίν’ αἶτίαν ἔχωνετίι) ἄλλην uirium ἔχωνς

1205. πείσειν here governs two accusatives, τίνοι and τάδε, the former
of the person, the latter of the thing. -

1206. εἰ βούλοιο, nana· On this passage Matthiae remarks that the
spodosis of the conditional proposition must be sup lied from the
context, the whole sentence being, t· ὁμολογήσειας ἂν, εξ βούλοιο τάληθῆ
λέγειν. This, however, is common to all languages. Thus, in English
we εέιοιιΙᾶ say, “ Gold, if you would but confess the truth, led you
to '⁸ c.

’1211. τί δ’ οὔ τότ’. 'l'he conJunotion δὲ is inserted to resume the
sense after the lon parenthesis beginning with ὅτ’ ηὐτύχει and ending
with δόρυ. So s or vero is used in Latin, and then or well then in
En lish.

18214. ἐν φάει, ‘' in the light of prosperity.”

1215. καπνῷ· ἐσήμηνε πολεμίων ὑπο (ἀπολόμενον), “gave signs at tho
hands of its enemies by its smoke (that it was destroyed). So the
