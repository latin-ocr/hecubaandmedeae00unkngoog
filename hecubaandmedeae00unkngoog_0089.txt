THE HECUBA. 75

common phrase ἐσήμηνε τῇ σάλπιγγι, ‘the trumpeter sign alled with the

ι trumpet,” is used independently, and even without an expressed sub—
ject. Porson reads ἐσήμαιι), with Aldus.

1217. πρ ὸς τοῖσδε, “in addition to this,” introduces new matter·
what hadp hitherto been said being merely an answer to Polymestore
Βῆιέῧθῃξρῆν· is even commonet in Attic poetry than ἐχρῆν. So ἄνωγα,
καθεζόμην, καθεῦδον, καθήμην are always found in the tragic writers,
though ἐκαθεζόμην, ἐκαθεΰδον, and ἐκαθήμην are also used by the comio

πῗῗέε. πενομένοις, ie. during the siege, not after they had enriched

themselves with the spoils of Troy, as indeed is evident from v. 1222
οὐξιὲ2ι2ῗ Ξῖλμεαζ.λ’ See note on v. 326. -ἔχων καρτερεΐς, “perseverest in
116322245„ τ Ηιέφων ὲν. κτὸν ἑμδνετρέφων μὲν τὸν ἐμὸν παῖδα, ὥς ἐχρῆν σε
τρέφειν αὐτὸν, κα1 σώσας αὐτόν, the words belonging to one another being
rather rou ghly divided from one another.

1226. ἃ γαθο1 by orasis for οἱ ἀγαθο1.
1227. αὔθ’ ἕκαστα,“ ‘each of them of themselves? ie. “of their own

naturef' ultro. For a similar sentiment see Shakspeare, Ham. iii. 2

Who not needs, shall never lack a friend:
And who‘· m want a hollow friend deth try,
Directl y sea-sons him his enemy.

1228. ό δὲ, i. e. Poly dorus,

1230. ἐκεῖ νον ἅνδραῖ· ι. e. Agamemnon.

1231. παῖδές τε σοὶ, i. e. οἴχονται. Person, by omittingacomma, makes
the predicate of παῖδες to be πράσσουσιν ωδε, understood m πράσσεις ὧδε;
but, as the children were dead, it seems better to connect them with the

revious verb. ·
p 1234. οἷς ἐχρῆν, i. e. πιστὸν εῖναι.

1286. αὐτὸν. .σὲ, “you yourselss’' αὐτὸν being especially emphatic
from its position.

1237. τοιοῦτον ὄντα, “being just the same,’ ’is put euphemistically
for κακὸν ὄντα, for the reason that she' 1s a slave, as she intimates' ιιι the
words δεσπότας δ’ οὔ λοιδορῶ.

1238. φεῦ is here an interiection, not of regn-et, but of pleasure or
admiration. So soph. Phil. 234,

φεῦ τὸ καὶ λαβεῖν
πρόσφθεγμα ronow ἀνδρός.

1238- 9. The sentiment contained ιιι this speech of the Chorus· is ιι
reflection of the first five lines of Hecuba' s speech, viz. vv. 1187-

111240. ἆ χθεινὰ. For the adj ective' m the predicate after the v ιιι-1) εῖναι

being often put‘ m the plural,J where we should expect the singular, see
noia? {153} ⁰⁷ ,οὔτ’ οὖν. As οὖν is often used to express the resump-

is very frequent with οὔτε. .,οὔτε either in company wint} the
