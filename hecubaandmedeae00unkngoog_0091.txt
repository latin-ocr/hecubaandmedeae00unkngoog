present, as it often is in cases “ubi indefinita plane temporis est
significatio, et praesertim generaliter loquimur de persona vel re quoe
ita agere vel agi solet? So Hermann apud Vig. p. 209, who quotes S.
Matthew, iii. 17, Οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ υἱός μου ὁ ἀγαπητὸς, ἐν ᾦ εὐδόκησα (i. e.
acquiesco vel acquievi); where the Aorist gives the sense “ in quo ab
<emitae usque acquiescere colec, acquiesco, et in oetemitatem acquiescam?
So ἀπέπτυσα has here the meaning of ‘³ 1 have long abominated and
shall continue to abominate γουΓ-αἴηῷ ταῦτα, κ.τ.λ. So in Latin ¹we
have the phrases, “Di averruncent ;’' “Di bene vortant ;'’ “ Quod
illorum capiti sit ;” “ In ipsorum caput recidat.”
1278. “ μήπω verecunde in votis pro μήποτε dicebant. Soph. Elect-
403. οὐ δῆτα· μήπω νοῦ ’τοσόνδ’ εἵην κενή.” Pflugk.
1279. κ’ αὐτόν ’γε τοῦτον, i. e. κτενεῖ.
1280. οὗτος σὺ--Ιιειιε m. See note on v. 1127.
1285. νήσων ἐρήμων . . . depende on ποι, ννὴίοὴῖε an adverb of place,
{nd canLtheresore govern a genitive, just like ubi locmm, quo locorum,
c., in atin.
1286. καὶ λίαντ-υεῑ maxime. The addition of acal gives greater em·
phasis to λίαν, as often in Homer.
1287. διπτύχους νεκροὺς, i. e. the bodies of Polydorus and Polyxena.
1290. τάσδε. For the force of the pronoun see note on v. 53.

. 1296. στερρὰ γὰρ ἀνάγκη. The same mournful wail about the un-

alterableness of destiny recurs over and over again in both Greek and
Roman literature. “ In the ancient world destiny‚ even though carried
on and developed by the volitions and actions of man, nevertheless
stood, as an unalterable necessity, directly opposed to his freedom of
will. . . In the Christian view of things, on the other hand, there is no
such rule as that of destiny. God there regulates the course of history
by his love and justice, and because He is a pure, living, aelf-acting
and free personality‚ He can and does set limit to Himself in
order to give liberty to man; consenting to and permitting the
independent development of his spirit, to which, even because it
is and ever will be spirit, He has conceded a free causation, and a ’
spontaneous and creative operation. While to Himself and His
Providence He reserves the objective disposition of the consequences
and effecte of human conduct; on the other hand, having restored to
man what he had lost by the Fan, the possibility of redemption and
sanctification, He leaves him to work but this great end by his own
free agency, and the assistance of the indwelling eo·operation of the
Holy spirit of Christ.” Ulrici's Shakspeare’s Dramatic Art.
