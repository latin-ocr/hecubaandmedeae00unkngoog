NOTES ΟΝ THE MEDEA.

*4-

ΤΗΕ Medea was brought out by Euripides, Re. 431, as a part of a trilogy
composed of the Medea, the PhilocteteS, and the Dictys, together with
the satyr-ic drama of the Theristae.

The chief interest of the Medea, the only one of the series that has
been preserved, turns, like that of the Hecuba, on the character of a
woman. Medea, daughter of AEetes‚ king of ColchiS, had helped
Jason‚ the leader of the Argonauts, to overcome the difficulties that
stood in the way of his getting the golden fleece, had killed her own
brother Absyrtus, and scattered his limbs on the sea, to delay her
father in his pursuit of the Arge, and so enable Jason to escape, on the
strength of Jason's promise that he would take her to Greece with him,
and there marry her. On the safe arrival of the Argo at Iolcos, J ason
fulfils his promise, Medea, to avenge J ason for the sufferings inflicted
on his father by Pelias, puts Pelias to death through the instrumenta·
lity of his own daughters, and thereby so rouses popular indignation
that she and J ason are bothpbliged tooflee ‘⁶.⁰. Corinth. Here J ason,

the play begins. Medea in the opening scene is described by her
attendants as now raving against her husband, now dissolved in tears,
now casting sullen and angry glances at her children, as if they shared
their father’s fault. Soon she comes on the stage herself, and, with all
the passionateness of an Eastern nature, utters aloud all her grief and
all her rage, dwells on the helpless position of all women socially, and
her own specially desolate situation, and engages them to remain
silent if she should carry out the schemes of revenge she is brooding
over. Creon now comes to tell her that she must depart from Corinth
forthwith. She with difficulty obtains one day’s respite, ostensibly
that she may think what to dc, and how she may provide for her
children, but really that she may provide for herself an asylum, and

’ mature her plans. Jason then comes to her to persuade her that

all her misfortunes spring from herself, that he is marrying again
for her good, and the good of her and his children, and that she would
never have been banished, if she could have controlled her temper. In
answer Medea indignantly recounts 811 her good deeds towards him,
and his oaths, his pe ‘ury, and his ingratitude to her. Jason, after a
larffisamount of coldElooded and sophistical reasoning in justification
of ' conduct, leaves her with the hypocritical declaration that he is
the injured party, and so winds her up to such a degree of resentment„
