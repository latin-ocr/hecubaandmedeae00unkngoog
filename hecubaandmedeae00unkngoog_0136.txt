11101 0110 10 01 1001 ready to commit 1110 deeds she has been meditating,
yet half shrinking from hitherto.

Soon after AEgeus, king of Athens (the city that the spectatore of the
play would, of course, look on as the natural friend of the unfortunate),
comes upon the stage, hears her story, pities her, and promises her the
desired place of refuge in case 01 110οᾶ. Ηο1 future being thus secured‚
she rapidly executes her plans of revenge. She sends for Jason under
the pretence that she repents her foolish vehemence, and wishes her
children not to be driven into banishment along with her, makes him
promise to second her request that they may remain in Corinth, and sends
them with a present of splendid but poisoned robes to Glauce. Glauce,
tempted by the gista, consents 10 101 1110 children remain, puts on the
robes, and is destroyed by them along with her father. Medea 111011
kills her children to prevent their being killed by the Corinthiam, and
to grieve the beart of their father3 places their bodies in a fiery cha-
1101 given her by her grandfather, the Sun3 and, when J ason comes to
save his children from the avengers of the king, taunts him with his
conduct and its results, points out how 1011017 1110 life will be, and how
completely she has avenged herself on him, and then floats away, borne
by her fiery coursers, leaving him to his misery and despair.

This brief outline of the plot will give but an imperfect notion of
the skill with which the character of Medea is conceived and sustained.
Her impetuosity and vehemence, and susceptibility of 110011, her vacil-
lations of purpose, as she is acted on alternately 07 1011ᾱο111000 for her
children, and rage against her husband, and her ultimately daring and
suffering all things to wring his heart to the uttermost‚ these are all
depicted 07 0110 who has seen far more deeply into woman’s heart than

in spite of all that she does, with a noble nature, and ascribe its per-
version 1ο 1110 meanness of her husband’s conduct, and retain our sym-
pathy with her to the end.

J ason is drawn 07 1110 poet 00 cold, calculating, ungrateful, and

Creon, the king of Corinth, is not very prominently brought
forward. . He is evidently, however, intended to be drawn as a
man of no great force of character, with some kindly elements in his
nature.

AEgeus, on the other hand, as being one of the hero-kings of Athens,
is represented as chivalrous in his feelingst, indignant at wrong-
doing, and anxious at once 10 shield the unfortunate. His astonish-
ment that his bare word should require 10 00 0011011011οᾱ by an cath,
