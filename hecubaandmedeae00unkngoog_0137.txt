THE MEDEA. 123

‚ The nurse and the slave-tutor exhibit the fidelity and affection for
the family to which they belong, which so often sprang up in old time .
h slaves towards their masters, in spite of the compulsory form of the
relationship, through the mildness of the treatment to which they
were subjected, and the community of sentiment which naturally
flowed from their equality of knowledge. The way, however, in
which both of the slaves in question take the part of Medea against
her husband, helps powerfully to make the spectators do the same.

The narration of the death of Glauce and her father by the mes·
senger who comes in to tell the news, though inferior, from the nature
of the subiect, in pathos to that of the herald in the Hecuba, is still very
vividly and powerfully written; but there is naturally very little in it
that is distinctive of the speaker. It should be noticed, however, that
he incidentally depicts Glauce as so selfish and frivolous, that it becomes
more 'evident than ever that Jason turns from Medea to her for none
but the most unworthy reasons.

The Chorus consists of Corinthian ladies, deeply sympathising‚ as '

women, with Medea's wrong. Nothing, however, can be more jarring
to modern feelings than the way in which they listen to Medea's mur·
derous plots against her husband and children, and against their own
King and Princess, with a perfect consciousness how wicked and inex-
cusable these plots are, yet without any effort on their part to prevent
the catastrophe by warning Creon on the one hand, or protecting the
children on the other. It is true that they are faithfully occupying the

they commit treason, and violate the plainest duties without any excuse
on the score of morality. Had they, instead of being Corinthian ladies‚
been Medea’s own attendants, personally attached to her, and not bound
by ties of duty to Creon, their conduct would appear less anomalous.
It must be allowed, however, that from the stand-point of the ancients
these ¹gbjections would, from custom, appear less forcible than they
must us.

When the Chorus first enter, singing, chiefly in anapaestic measure,
as was usual for them when in motion, they inquire what are Medea's
present feelings, express their sympathy with her, regret the continu-
'ance of her love for Jason, and wish to see, and speak to, and console
her (vv. 131—2120. In vv. 357-363, after Creon has ordered her to
leave before the next day, they again express their sorrow for her in
the same measure. In vv. 409-444 they sing in dactylico-trochaic
and glyconio strains the first stasimon‚ or ode sung standing ;' in
which they dwell upon the total subversion of right and wrong obsm‘v-
able in J ason’s conduct, and the degradation of the moral character of
man, and the elevation of that of woman, in popular esteem, that must
necessarily result from so flagrant an instance of marital faithlessness.
In vv. 627-662, forming the second stasimon, and written in dactylico-
trochaic and choriambic metre, the Chorus dwells on the evils of im-
moderate love, whether it prompte men to burn ἑτέροις ἐπὶ λέκτροις
on the one hand, or leads them to give up home and all previous ties
on the other hand, and points out how it is productiva of all evils3 as,
for instance, of utter friendlessness in the case of Medea, and of the
loss of all domestic happiness in the case of Jason. In vv. 824-865
