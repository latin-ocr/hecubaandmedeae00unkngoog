the third stasimon, written in a metre similar to that of the preceding
one, occurring, as it does, just after Medea’s interview with AEgeus, and
his promise of hospitality,' launches naturally out in praise of Athene,
and expresses a fear of its being polluted by giving shelter to a mur·
deress3 thus offering a natural and graceful tribute to the patriotic

¹ feelings of the Athenian spectatore of the play. In the fourth stasimon “

(vv. 976—1001)‚ still written in nearly the same metre as those above, “
the Chorus helplessly bewails the coming catastrophe, which it foresees
without being able to prevent, and moans indiscriminately over Glauce,
Jason, and Medea3 while in some anapaestic lines (vv. 1081—1115), it
does little more than paraphrase‚ though in very frigid and common·
place terme, Medea’s impassioned words (vv. 1025—1037), and decides Ἴ
that it is perhaps, on the whole, better not to have any children at all
than to be torn by the anxieties that they bring with them. 'I'he last
stasimon (vv. 1251-1292), written as befits the excitament and indig-
nation necessarily connected with the subject, in dochmiacs, consiste of
an adjuration ΒΥ the Chorus to Medea, not to do what they know she is
going to do, and a solemn proposal among themselves to help those .
whom they know they are not going to help. Lastly they finish the
play, as in the Hecuba, with a short exodic strain to the effect that
Jove rules over all, and delights to balk the expectations of mortale by
bringing about the exact opposite of that which they would naturally
look for. Hence, on the whole, we see that, contrary to what we found
to bethe case in the Hecuba, all the songs of the Chorus reflect and
help on the action of the play.

'I'he old remark that Euripides hated women has been founded,
perhaps, in great measure on this play3 but Miiller’s acute remark is

undertakings, fine-spun plane, as a general rulo, originate with the
female character, is quite equal to any reproaches which he puts on
women” (Hist. of Lit. of Greece, p. 360).

Beautiful as this play is on the whole, it is still possible to point out
one or two minor faults in its construction, besides those already
adverted to in connection with the Chorus. For in the first place we
may notice, as in the case os the Hecuba, the purely epical nature of
the commencement of the· prologue. That this was felt ΒΥ Euripides
himself as well as by his cotemporaries to be an error in art, is shown 3
by the excuse he makes for it in this play (vv. 49—58). See, however,
the manner in which Mfiller justifies him in the passage quoted from
his writings in p. 38 of this edition. A more serious objection is that
tho catastrophe ,seems to explain nothing, to solve no moral difficulty,
and to ‘administer no consolation to the spectatore. The painful feel-
ing excited by the tlaughter of the innocent children is unalloyed by
any burst of grief on the part of the mother, any exhibition of repent-
ance on that of the father. The heart of the on-lookers is agonized‚
but learns nothing from its agonies‚ and we are almost led to adopt
the opinion which seems hinted at by the Chorus in the concluding
lines of the play, that there is no Providence, and that the skein of
events is hopelessly tangled. Another objection is one raised by Aris·
totle (Poet. c. xv.), that the solution of the plot is brought about, as in
