positive merite of this splendid exhibition of human passion. It may
be added that the three unities of time, place, and action, are
carefully preserved throughout. Everything takes place in front of
Medea’s abode in the course of a single day, and there is but one plot
throughout, which opens at the commencement of the play, and is
brought ιο a successful termination at the end.

SCENE Ι.

ΤΗΕ scene throughout the play is laid in Corinth in frent of the
Royal Palaee, with the house of Medea, once J ason's too, on one side,
and the bridal house of Jason and Glauce on the other. In the fore-
ground would probably be scen the statues of Zeus and of the Sun, and
of the other Deities appealed to by Medea in the play.

Medea's nurse enters expressing her regret that the Argo was ever
built, and that her mistress and Jason ever met. She then describes
Jason’s conduct, and Medea's state of mind, and states her fear that
Medea will do something desperate to avenge herself, The slave-tutor
then enters, and tells her that he has heard tha·- it 'es purposed to banish
Medea and her children from Corinth at once. Th.- nurse then urges
him ιο keep the children out of their mother* s sigub, for fear she should
pour out her violence on them, and the slave-tutor goes off the stage to
carry out her advice. Medea's voice is then heard from within the
palace, cursing her husband, and threatening to destroy him and her
children, whereby the fears of the nurse are of course increased.

'I'he metre in which Medea expresses her passion, and the nurse her
apprehensions (vv. 96-130), consist, in consequence of the emotions it
is intended to delineate, of the irregular anapaests described in p. 39.

This scene, being anterior to the entrance of the Chorus, would be
called by the Greeks the πρόλογος. See the remarks on the use of this
and other Greek terms for the divisione of a play in p. 39.

Prof. Conington as wishing with the scholiast to read Κόλχων ἐς Αἶαν,

“to AEa of the Colchians;'' AEa being the name given to the land
before the time of Pindar and AEschylus, as AEetes is the name of its
king in the legend. See Smith’s Diot. of Geog., where Colchis is said
nearly to correspond with Mingrelia and that part of Abbasia which
lies south and west of Mount Ebura—nevarens- Συμπληγάδας. So Byron
speaks of “the blue Symplegades.'' These rocks, called simply Κυανέα.
