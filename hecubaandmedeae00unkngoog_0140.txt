stsntly joining together and separating, and to be therefore the terror
of navigators. J ason, however, and his companions were advised by
Phineus to send a dove through before them, and learn from its good or
ill success what wesin store for them. The dove escaped with the loss
of a few of the feathers of its tan, and the Argo was in consequence
impelled through, and passed safely‚ with the exception of part of the
stern ornament. The Symplegades oonsist of two little islands, one on
each side of the Strait of Constantinople, and the fable of their some-
times joining and sometimes separating is said by the writer in Smith’s
Dict. to have risen from the fact that they are only islands in rough
westher, and then each of them, through inundation of the low-lying
parts, appears broken up into separate insular rocks.

6. Πελίᾳ, “ for Pelias.''' Pelias, when J ason claimed the throne of
Iolcos as his by right from his father, persuaded J ason to seek the

perish in the attempt—01³1 γὰρ ἂν, ὅξέοι· (if the Argo never had been

as ie might be in Engnsfi.

7. πύργους, “ to the towers‚'' the proposition of motion being omitted,

killed AEson under the conviction that the Argonauta never could
return, persuaded the daughters of Pelias to kill him and cut him in
pieces, under pretence that she could boil him in her magio cauldron
into renewed youth and beauty. For this, however, Medea and her
husband were banished by the citizens of Iolcos, and took refuge in
Corinth. Another version of the legend represents AEson as still alive
when the Argonauts returned, and describes him as restored to youth
by Medea. So Shakspeare‚ Merchant of Venice, Act v. scene 1.
