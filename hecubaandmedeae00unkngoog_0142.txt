46. οἶδε . . . στείχουσι, “here come.'' See note on Hec. 53. —
ἐκ τρόχων πεπαυμένοι, “ having left off (i. e. having come in from) their
games of running‚’' or as we, who are less athletic in our exercises,
should say, “having come in from their walk.” Some editors read
τροχῶν, i.e. “ hoops.’'

48. φιλεῖ, “ is wontl’

49. Elmsley quotes Ennius’s version of this and the next line:

Antiqua herilis fida custos corporis,
Quid sic extra aedes exanimata eliminas ἲ

κτῆμα. This is a common expression for a slave. So Aristotle
calls a slave ἔμψυχον κτῆμα, “a live chattel,’' as being essentially a thing,
and only accidentally a person. In spite of Christianity the Southern
confederate States of America have the same opinion now appa-
rently. 'IJorson says, “ Nutricem alloquitur tanquam vilissimam

51ΞῩ58. For this defence of Euripides’ plan of beginning his plays
with a long monologue, see Introduction.

52. σοῦ depends on λείπεσθαι, which, like other verbs of plenty or
want, governs a genitive.

54. ξυμφορὰ, the substantive in the predicate, is, as is often the case
in Greek, of a different number from the substantive which is the
subject. See Matth. Gr. Gr. ἓ 309, b.

55. φρενῶν &vocem-em.. The same construction occurs in v. 1360.

56. εἷς τοῦτο ἀλγηδόνος, “ eo doloris 3 ” the genitive being added to
define the direction. So Eur. Alc. 9, εἰς τόδ’ ἡμέρας.

67. This practice of retailing one's distresses to earth and heaven, so
common among the poete, is ridiculed by Plautus, Mero. prol. 3 sqq„ as
quoted by Klotz.

N on ego item facio, ut alios in comoediis
Vidi facere amantes, qui aut nocti aut dii
Aut soli aut lunae miserias narrant suas.

But see note on vv. 51—58. μ’ ὑπῆλθε is put for με ὑπῆλθε,
not μοι ὑπῆλθε, in spite of the dative μολουσῃ, which follows by
an irregularity of construction for μολοῦσαν. So Iph. A. 491, ἄλλως τέ
μ’ ἔλεος τῆς ταλαιπώρου κόρης Ἐ ’” ’ quoted by
Pflugk. A& ‘L- s] [fij

60. ζηλῶ σε, “ Ι envy you,” will eit ef c‘ffitory meaning
or not, according to the nature of the context. Here it evidently is
ironical‚ as Elmsley says, and = ‘⁸ I pity you for your folly in thinking
s0.” In the passages quoted by Paley from AEsch. Prom. 338, and
Soph. El. 1027, it is not ironical, because the person addressed is
envied for a really good thing3 and therefore all notion of. irony is ex·
cluded—e'v ἀρχῇ πῆμα. So S. Matth. xxiv. 8, “ All these thiu are the
beginning of sorrows.” 77 “A χρυ f JY'QCS‘ (A) - [Φ Cq'wfff

61. μῶρος, i. e. Medea, the m cuhne being use or the feminine, aa
xf the adjective had only two terminatione.

63. μὴ φθόνει, “ grudge not.”
