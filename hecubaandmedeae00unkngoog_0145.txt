131-212, A chorus of Corinthian ladies, having heard Medea’s
groans of grief, enters to inquire how she fares; expresses a hope, in
answer to her repeated imprecatione on her husband, that she will cease
to care for him,.as no longer worthy of her, and then persuades the nurse
to go into the palace and ask Medea to come out to listen to the words
of sympathy and friendly counsel that they are ready to offer. While
the nurse goes out to execute their wish, they sing a short stmin,
descriptive of Medea’s desolate state.

The metre used in vv.131—137, which form the first part of the
πάροδος, οι· entrance-som of the, Chorus is anapaestis in the first two
lines, and dactylic in all the rest, with the exception of the last, which is
iambic. 'Phe rapidity of movement thus given to these lineS, indicates
{he haste with which the Chorus rushed in at the sound of Medea's

amentations. -

131. For the reason of the use of δὲ in this line, see note on v. 99.

134. ἐπὶ, “while standing near on the way to the orchestra.” Paley
proposes ἀπὺ.- ἀμφιπόλου μελάθρου. There were two door· to the
palace; the outer one, communicating with the street, called αὔλειος
θύρα, and the inner one, communicating with the γυναικών, οι· γυναικ-
ωνῖτις, called the ε’ταυλοξ, or μέσαυλος θύ -ἔσω must be 'oined to

137. φίλον, i. e. δῶμα derstood from δώματος.

139. οὐκ εἶσὶ δόμοι, “there is not any house,” i.e. t e house (or
family) is ruined. So we say “ the house of Brunswick,” meaning “the
family of Brunswick.” The change from the singular to the plural is
remarkable.-vc13’ “ all such things.’' ‘

140. τὸν μὲν, i. e. J ason.

146. καταλυσαίμην is transitive in th‘e mid le voice, and govems
βιοτὰν, which must be repeated after προλιποῦσοι.

148-159. This ode begins with three lines of irregular anapaestic
measure, to express the excited feelings of the Chorus (who must still
be looked on as in motion), and then, for the most part, melts into

¹ choriambic or glyconio measure, to express the gentler and sadder

utterances of the subsequent lines.

149. νύμφα may be applied, as Pflugk remarks, to any woman married
to a man in lawful matrimony. ·
