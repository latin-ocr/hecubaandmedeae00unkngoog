,THE MEDEA. 133

191. σκαιοὺς κ.τ.λ. Campbell 1166 given the following paraphrase of
the thought involved in this and the following lines:

Tell me, ye bards, whose 611111 sublime
First chat-med the ear of youthful Time,
With numbers wrapt in heavenly fire ;
Who bade delighted Echo swell

'I'he trembling transports of the lyre,
The murmur of the 6116112

Why to the burst of J oy alone

Accords sweet Music’s soothing tone?
Why can 110 bard with magio strain,

In slumber steep the heart of pain 3
While varied tones obey your sweep,
The mild, the plaintive, and the deep,
Bends not despairing Grief to hear
Your golden lute with ravished 661· 3
Has all your art no power 1ο bind

The fiercer pangs that shake the mind,
And lull the wrath at whose command
Murder bares her gory hand?

When flushed with joy the rosy throng
Weave the light dance, ye swell the song.
Cease ye vain warblers, cease to charm !
The breast with other raptui-es warm 2
Cease till your hand with magio stt-ain
In slumbers steep the heart of pain.
