Medea, in compliance with the request of the Chorus, now comes
upon the stage; dilates upon the total dependence of women on the
caprices of their husbands‚ and on the wretched state to which she
above all women is reduced by Jason's cruelty and ingratitude, and
begs the Chorus to promise not to betray her in her efforts to avenge
herself upon him. Just as they have promised to comply with this

as he supposes, where she shall betake herself. As soon as Creon is,
gone, the Chorus, in a short anapaestic ode, laments the insufficiency of ·
the time granted. But Medea declares it quite enough to enable her
to punish Jason, Glauce and Creon, if only she can in the meanwhile
discover some secure place of shelter, after the deed is done.
'l'he Chorus, in a series of dactylico-trochaic lines, then proclaims that
J ason's evil conduct will have the effect of transferring the ill-fame,
that has frequently been the lot of women, on to 'the shoulders of men,
and then in some softly flowing lines, partly glyconio, depicts the
desolate position of Medea, who ad given up her all for one who was
now deserting her. The portion of the play included between the o ening
of Scene 111„ and the chorus just mentioned would be called y the
Greeks the first episode‚ as being inserted between the first and second
series of choral odes. The choral song, contained in vv. 409-444,
constitute the first stasimon, or song, that was sung by the Cho us
while standing still. „tf ΛΘ Ι, (1¹ 3 f· fd)
