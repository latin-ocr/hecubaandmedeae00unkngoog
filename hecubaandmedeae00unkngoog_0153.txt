THE MEDEA. 139

as a contemptuous name for the Corinthiam (Sisyphus’s character
being none of the best), the repetition of the article with the addition
of the conjunction seems to bring J ason into correlation with the
descendants of Sisyphus, as being equally contemptible with them.
Thus the line, “to the Sisyphean, aye, and Jasonic bridals,'' becomes
equivalent to “ to Glauce, who is sprung from that wretch Sisyphus,
and to that equally contemptible wretch, Jason.''

409. ἄνω ποταμῶν. Cicero (xv. Ep. ad Att. 14) quotes⁸ these two
words as if the lines in which they occur had grown into a proverb ε
“Si vero etiam Carfulenus: ἄνω ποταμῶν.” That is, ‘⁶ If Carfulenus
has gone over to Octavius, then we may expect rivers to flow back·
warde, or anything else to happen.” So Horace Ι. Carm. xxix. 10:
