Argo to Poseidon on the Isthmus, and called on Medeia to take ven-
geance on Pelias for killing his father and mother in his absence. Medeia
prevailed on the daughters of Pelias to cut their father in pieces, and
boil them, pretending that thereby they would restore him to youth

and vigour, as she had before changed a ram into a lamb, by boiling the
dissected parts of his body in a cauldron. But Pelias remained dead,

and his son Acastus expelled J ason and Medeia from Iolcos.’' e

491. συγγνωστὸν ἦν σοι is the reading of the best and most ume

manuscripts. Dindorf has συγγνωστ) ἂν ἦν σοι. But, as ,erm nn,

quoted by Pflugk‚ observes, the ἂν in such constructions may be omitted

493. εἴ . . . ἢ. The reading of he manuscrip s is ἢ . . . ἢ. But

Hermann has changed the former ἢ into εἶ, on the ground that ἢ
