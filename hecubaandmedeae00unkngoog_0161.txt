mmmm, according to Hermann. That is to say. ἁμέραν τάνδ’ ἐξανύσασα
επριν ἐξανύσαι τήνδε τὴν ἡμέραν. However, as it is difficult to think this
even on the authority of Hermann, it seems better to understand, with
Paley‚ by ἁμέραν τάνδε not “ the day of poverty,'' but “this my present

sympathises with Medea3 promises her a sase refuge at Athens, and,
having obtained from her an assurance that she can gain him the
offspring he is desirous of, returns at once homeward (vv. 663-7 63).

wherein in the former half they sing the praise of Athens, and in the
second half express doubts whether so holy a city can receive Medea,
if she becomes unholy by the murder of her own children, and therc-
fore entreat her once more to draw back from her purpose. 2
