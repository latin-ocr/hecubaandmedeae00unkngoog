Q

locus est particulae γὰρ, quia intelligitur semper nescio, vel dic mihi, vel
simile quid.” Herm. ad Vig.

694. ἐφ’ ἡμῖν, “ in addition to ωθ.”-δεσπότιν, “as a legitimate wife.''
Aconcubine or wife of the second rank would have been allowable. So
Sarah allowed Abraham to marry Hagar, but she would never have
allowed him to marry one equal in rank to herself.

696. ἦ γὰρ. So most editors read against the manuscripts for ἦ που,
on tbe ground that ἦ που is ironical (= ἴσως or ὡς ἔοικε. See Elmsley on
v. 1308), and that there is uo room for irony in this passage, but
rather the expression of astonishment and indignatiou. Schone,
following Witzschel, proposes, οὕ που, ⁴‘ Surely he has not,'' dte.

696. πρὸ τοῦ = πρὸ τούτου is a relic of old times, when there was
no distinction of form⁴ between the article and the ‚demonstrative

ronoun.
p 698. μέγαν γ’ ἔρωτα, i. e. ἐρασθείς.

6991.1 ἵτω νυν, “ Then let him g0‚” i. e. “forget him3 blot him out of

our eart.''
5 703. μεντᾶρ’ is Hermann's correction for μὲν γὰρ, the meaning of
which is obviously unsuitable to the context. f ,-

705. πρὸς τοῦ = πρὸς ‘rivom ..- c L« W

707. ἐπῄνεσα. For the meaning of the aorist, as epr-essing an im·
mediate and settled feeling, see note on v, 223. a γ ωΐωὙ-’ Me)

708. καρδίᾳ δὲ βούλεται. The reading of al ost all the MSS. is ·
καρτερεῖν δὲ βούλεται, which makes exactly the opposite of the sense re
quired. Hence, Paley proposes καρτερεῖν δ’ οὐ βούλεται, which, as
Porsen also sees, was the reading of one of the Scholiasts, who says,
ἒέἔῳοέξέ. ῗὲἕέωἱῖᾇῖἳ ’Ξὶῗ ἓξὲἰζῖᾱῗὲξὶῗόἱρέἰῖε κὲιᾱᾶἵιῖξχὶἒῖᾴτςῑὲἒί
reading of another3 tge only objection to it being, that it looks as if it
had been adopted in order to get rid of a difficulty.

712. ἐκπεσοῦσαν εἷσίδῃς. See note on v. 25.

714. οὕτως is often used with the optative to express the condition
on which it is wished that the benefit prayed ior may be conferred. Sc,

iu Hor. L, Carm. 111. 1, “Sic te diva potem, Cypri‚” dcc. So, tec, 1.
Prop. xviii. 11,

Sic mihi te referas, levis, ut non altera nostro
Limine formosos intulit ulla pedes.

720. θεῶν, sc. ἕκατι, i. e. especially for the sake of those gods who con-

cern themselves about the prayers of suppliants. 2
722. ἐς τοῦτο, ecs-L, “for as to this 1 am extinct,” i. e. “ y house, , ῐ

as 1 have no heirs, is all but extinct. ffb'M α, ιο ί (ὅν z Q ⁶ s [ί ¹
724. o· υ προξενεῖν, “ to be your proxenus.'' The πρόξενος d· ega* ί

from th ξένοὲ, as public guest-friendship did from private. ,
726. geue does not wish to take Medea away with him, for fear he .

should eem to be willingto pick a quarrel, At the same time, he will

not sh ' k from a quarrel, if it should be brought on by doing his duty

to a uppliant who throws herself on the hospitality of his state.

This s, of course, a delicate stroke of flattery on the part of Euripides

to t e Athenians. .
