737.‘ ‘But havmg agreed me in words, and being under an
oath to the gods, you will belcome my friend, and will not listen to
their message (lit. messages by a herald).” Porson reads ἀνώμοτος from
the var. lect. of two manuscripts, and then follows Wyttenbach' in sub-
stituting τάχ’ ἂν πίθοιο for οὐκ ἂν πίθοιο, “cum negativa particula sensui
noceatl‘ But as the negative particle is in all the manuscripts, it
evidently ought to be left undisturbed, and the reading that stands m
the place of ἀνώμοτος, 1ιι almost all the manuscripts, tried, as in the
text. If, however, Porson’s reading be retained, the meaning will be,

“But if you have agreed with me in words only, and are not under an
oath to the gods, then you may perhaps become friends with them, and
listen to their proposalsss' But besides the want of MSS. authority,
φίλος ’γένοι’ ἂν seems evidently, as Pfl. sayS, to refer more suitably to
Medea, and ἐπικηρεύκευμασι, κ. τ. λ., to the city of Corinth .-ἐνῶμοτος
πένώμοτος ὥν.

744. σκῆψιν, κ...,τλ “being able to show some excuse to your
enemies (for not surrendering you).”

745. τὸ σόν,’ ‘your safety? ’-ἄρ αρ ε is intransitive. See note on v,
322. -ἐξηγοῦ θεούς, “lead off (i. e. precite) the Gods (by whom you wish
me to swear).'’ So m Latin praeire verbis, “to recite the formula of
consecration for others to repeat it afterwards.u See Livy y, ix. 46,

“Coactus pontifex maximus verba praeire.” Sch6ne quotes Plaut.

746. ὄμνυ for ὄμνυθι. So Arist. AveS‚ 666. ἔκβαινε καὶ σαυτὴν ἑπι-
δείκνυ τοῖς ξένοις.

747. Notiee the insertion of τε, as if there were a participle in the
preceding line for συντιθεὶς to be ‚tioined to.

748. δράσειν, i. e. ἐμέ.

7 52 λαμπρὸν Ἡλίου τε φῶς is the reading of most of the manuscripts.
1f this be the right reading, it is one of the instances ιιι which τε does

Messalam terra dum sequiturque mari.

Dindorf and others, however, have adopted Ἠλίου θ’ ἁγνὸν σέβας, a
common tragic expression, but very possibly introduced here to get
rid of the peculiar position of the conjunction.

763. ἐμμένειν ἅ σου κλύω, instead of the commoner ἐμμένειν oss σοι
κλύω. There would seem to be a similar absence of attraction in v.
758. On these passages Klotz remarks· ‘Nempe tum attractio facta
non est, si quando singula debebant magis per se ipsa constare; quod
