THE MEDEA. 161

in ista Medeae non minus solemni optatione qua prosequitur AEgeum.''
As to the instance, however, in v. 758, as Matth. observes (Gr. Gr.
ἓ 328, obs.), τυγχάνειν often governs the acc. of neuter pronouns‚ in
which case there would be no neglect of the ordinary rules of
atti-action.

7 54. πάθοις is the optative, because it expresses a wish, but is in the
second person because spoken by Medea, though meant for AEgeus.
‘⁶ Mayest thou suffer-whati if thou abidest not by thy oath.'' i. e.
‘⁶ What dost thou pray that thou mayest suffer, if‚” &a

759. Here the Chorus sings a short anapaestic strain (vv. 759—763)
in praise of AEgeus’s conduct. But it must be remembered that it is
said in motion, and is not a stasimon.——‹5 Μαίας, the son of Maia, i. e.
Mercury, who was πομπαῖος ἅναξ, “the Lord of escort,'' from his being
the initiator of all journeys of any kind, especially of the journeys of
the dead to Hades.

760. ὧν τε . . . πράξειας -- πράξειας τε ταῦτα ὧν ἐπίνοιαν κατέχων
σπεύδεις.

764. The Scholiast, as quoted by Pflugk, remarks that this line is
said in grateful soliloquy to the Beings mentioned in it.

766. εἷς ὁδὸν βεβήκαμεν, “ we have struck into the right road.’'

770. “ To him will I fasten my stern cable,'’ i. e. “By his means
shall Ι be able to weather the storm.'' ,

'cturatn.'' .

778. Since the construction is regular, if v. 77 7 be omitted, and
vv. 77 8-9, retained, or if, on the other hand, v. 777 be retained, and
vv. 7 7 8·9 omitted, Hermann supposes that v. 777 stood in one recen·
sion of the Medea, and the other two verses in the other, and. that, - in
the copies we have, the results of both recensions are preserved side by
side. Hence Dindorf has put the two latter lines in brackets. If we
preserve all three of the lines, we may either with Klotz suppose
’γάμους τυράννων οὕς . . . ἔχει to be put for οὓς ’γάμους τυράννων ἔχει,
much as virgil wrote Urbem quam statuo vestra est, for quam urbem.
statuo ea vestra ast,- or, with Paley, take ’γάμους to be the subject of
εἶναι in the next line, having ξύμφορα agreeing with it, much as Virgil
wrote triste lupus stabulis. There would still be a change of con-
struction after λέξω from ὡς with the indicative, to the accusative and
infinitive, but that would not be an uncommon thing in Greek.
Klotz quotes Thucyd. iii. 3, ἐσηγγέλθη γὰρ αὐτοις, ὥς εἴη Ἀπόλλωνος
Μαλόεντος ἔξω τῆς πόλεως ἑορτή, ἐν ᾖ πανδημεὶ Μυτιληναῖοι ἑορτάζουσι,
καὶ ἕλπιδα εἶναι ἐπειχθέντας ἐπιπεσεῖν ἄφνω. This does not account,
however, for the absence of a conjunction before γάμους.

781. λιποῦσα can only mean, if taken literally, what Scholefield says,
“having made up my mind to leave3 '' and the use of the aorist for
the future must be accounted for in the same way that the use of
, similar tenses in the latter chapters of Isaiah are accounted for, by
