949, but it evidently is required here to explain δῶρα in v. 784, and

show that it is synonymous with κόσμον in v. 787. ,
7 90. τόνδ’ ἀπαλλάσσεο λόγον, “ I dismiss this subject,’' i. e. “ I change

ᾑὴῗὲἶὺξιῗξιοξα. For this use of the aorist where we should use the

present imperfect, see note on v. 223.
795. φόνον i. e. μίασμα φόνου. Pfl. quotes Hipp. 35, μίασμα φεύγων

’ αἵματος Παλλαντίδων. ·

797. The subject of γελᾶσθαι is probably αὐτοὺς, the children being,
as Paley points out, referred to in τλᾶσ* ἔργον ἀνοσιώτατον, and Medea s
fear being throughout that her children should be exposed to the
derision of her enemies. See V. 782. She was quite certain that she
herself would be able to excite very different feelings. , ’

. 805. νύμφης τεκνώσει. For the gen. after verbs of producing, δια,
seeLHec. 380, and the note on it. So satus, editus, δια, govern an abl.
in atin.

Lofty and sour to them that loved him not,
But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.

815. Πάσχουσαν is the acc., though · σοι to which it refers is in tlte
dat. For other instances see Matth. Gr. Gr. ξ 536, obs.

817. γὰρ,·“ Yes, for sc, &c.''

819. οὑν -- οἱ ἐν. The ι is, according to rule, not taken into consi-
deration, and the ο and the ε contract as usual into ov. So οὑμοὶ for οἱ
ἐμοὶ in Hec. 334. ’

-820, Medea here turns to her nurse, who has followed in her train on

h the stagle. The next verse states the reason why she employa her on
t is erran .

822. λέξῃς δὲ μηδὲν. Porsen edite λέξεις δὲ μηδὲν without comment,
though μηδὲν can hardly stand with the future indicative. Hence
Elmsley alters λέξεις into λέξῃς, comparing Iph. T. 1220. θαυμάσῃς
μηδέν. Troad. 458. δακρύσῃς μηδέν. Herc. F. 215. δράσῃς μηδέν.
Scholefield‚ however, defends the original reading on the rather theo·
retical ground that “in λέξεις est mixta quaedam vis imperativae cum
affirmativa.”

823. δεσπόταις, i. e. Medea herself. The plural is often substituted
for the singular in emphatic passages in tragedy, and then the mascu-
line gender is always used, even when a woman is speaking, or spoken
of. See note on Hec. 403.—⁷yvv·b, ⁴‘ a woman, and therefore able to
understand a woman's feelings.”

824. ' ρεχθεΐδαι. The Atheniens were so called from ErechtheuS, or
Ericht niue, the son of Hephaestus, who ex elled Amphictyon from
the th ne of Athens, and suoceeded bime-‘t παλαὶον. See Thuc. Ι.
2. τ ’γοῦν Ἀεττικὴν ἐκ τοῦ ἐπὶ πλεῖστον διὰ τὸ λεπτόγεων ἀστασίαστον

82 . θεῶν mites-{as being connected with Erechtheus, who was himself
the n of Hephaestus.

8 6. ἀπορθήτου. See the quotation from Thucydides in the note on
v. 4. This boast, however, could not have been made, had the play
be written or acted one year later, as in the very year it was brought
