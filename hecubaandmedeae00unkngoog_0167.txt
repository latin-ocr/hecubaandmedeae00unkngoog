 

THE MEDEA.1.:3

out (Β, (1431)ὶὶιο Lacedaemonians came and ravaged a large portion of
Attica. See Τὴιιο.11.19,2ο.-ἆποφερβόμενοι σοφίαν, “feeding ou
wisffom ’' The same metaphor is found in Psalm, cxix. 103, 0and
P m xix. 10.

832. 'Phat Harmonia was the mother of the Muses is the graceful
invention of Euripides himself‘ ιιι this passage. The mythical Har-
monia was the wife of Cadmus3 and the mother of the Muses was
generally held to be Mnemosyne. Elmsley quotes Hesiod. Theog. 53.

τὰς ἐν Πιερίῃ Κρονίδῃ τέκε πατρὶ μιγεῖσα
Μνημοσύνη, ’γουνοῖσιν Ἐλευθῆρος μεδέουσα.

835. ροὰς is the acc. after ἆφυσσαμέναν.
837. χώραν is governed in the acc. by the preposition' m καταπνεῦσαι,
. where the gen. might have been expected. Hence Porson readsx χώρας
without any observation. Paley quotes Eur. Rhes. 388, καταπνεῖ σε,
and well aobserves that, as κατὰ with the gen. means motion down-
warde, and with the acc. motion over an extended surface, χώραν suits ⁴
the context better than χώρας.

840. ἐπιβαλλομέναν· is in the middle voice.

846. πῶς οὖν, κ.τ..λ “How then can either a city of such sacred
streams (i. e. of such holiness), or a place so conductive of friends
(1. e. ready to treat all strangers as friends), receive thee, the destroyer
of your children, the unholy one, along with its other gssuests' The
sacred sti· eams are the Cephisus and Ilissus. Pflug k quotes πύργοι
διδυμῶν ποταμῶν as a designation of Thebes from Phoen. 824. Hermann
objecting to the abnormal position of ἢ (which ought by rights to pre-
cede‘ ιερῶν ποταμῶν, if the translation given above be the correct one),
and pointing out that the fiist syllable of v. 846 occupied by πῶς,
ought to be short to correspond to the first syllable 1ιι v. 856, pro·
poses to read τὶς, and translates, “Ecquis te sacrorum fluminum,
ffibugbsin an amicorum prosecuti-ix regio prolis tuae interfectricem

e it'

850. μετ’ ἄλλων. It seems to be the simplest way, and to suit the
contest best, to take these words with ἕξει, as they are translated above.
Pflugk translates τὰν οὐχ’ ὁσίαν μετ’ maiust ‘quem non fas est cum
aliis vivere3 ”which is strained, but not abhorrent from the context.
Hermann proposes to change μετὰ into μέγα, and thus make με’-γ’
οὐχ’ ὁσίαν equivalent to a superlative, which is certainly a most
infelicitous emendation. Klotz agrees with the Scholiast in taking
μετ’ ἄλλων with σκέψαι, “Consider along with others the conse·
ςῃέἓὲθεαῗρὶι, ἀξιοιι undertake!

856. πόθεν θράσος, κ. τ. It: πόθεν θράσος ἢ φρενὸς ἢ χει ὸς καρδίας
τε (κατὰ) τέκνων σέθεν λήψει, δεινὰν (αὐτοῖς) προσάγ ουσα τ λμαν; Tho
datives χειρὶ and καρδίᾳ seem to be joined with the genitive φρενὸς
from a mixture of the construction given above, and the construction,
πόθεν θράσος ἢ φρενὶ ἢ χειρὶ καρδίᾳ τε λήψει. So Pflugk. Paley alters
τέκνων with Reiske into τέκνοις, joining τέκνοις with προσάγουσα. But
thisd seems to be too great an interference with the order of the
wor s·

861. ακρυν μοιραν σχήσεις φόνου. Klotz pronounces μοῖραν φόνου

to bessiuivalent to destinata ccedet, and quotes v. 987, καὶ μοῖραν
