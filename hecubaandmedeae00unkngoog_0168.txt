considered to be equivalent to ἔξεις, which it is not. Hence he pro-
poses to read φόνον, governing φόνον by ἄδακρυν 111 1118 88888 of μὴ

Jasou comes on the stage at his wife’s request 3 and she pretends
that she repents her former violence, and wishes him 10 prevail on
Glauce 10 intercede with her father, Creon, to allow the children to re-
main behind in Corinth. J ason consents, and she sends them with
beautiful but poisoned robes to Glauce, to tempt her to intercede by
the beauty and apparent value of the present (vv. 866-975). J ason
then departs with the children across the stage 10 Glauce's house;
Medea returns 10 her own house, and the Chorus, being left alone,
lament over the coming catastrophe, and bewail 1118 lot of Glauce,
Jason, and Medea herself (vv. 976-1001).

This scene coincides with what would by the Greeks be called the
fourth e pisode, as being between the fourth and fifth choral 011883

for the change, though the two words are certainly often csenfounded.
Hermann objects to ουτᾶν besides, on the ground that one would hardly
put the strengthening expression ουτᾶν, i e. non 8811881181· the adversa·
tive clause καὶ γὰρ οὖσα δυσμενὴς,· ‘ehouqh γο11 are hostile;' *whereas had
the preceding clause been καὶ ’γὰρ οὖσα <pians ‘uince you are friendly?
ουτᾶν might very well have followed.

871. νῷν, 1. 8. “to each by the other.’'

881. ἡμᾶς, 1. 8. Medea, the plural being used for the singular. See
note on v. 823. She probably does not mean to include her children,
