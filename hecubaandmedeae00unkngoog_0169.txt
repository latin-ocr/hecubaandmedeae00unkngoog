THE MEDEA. 155

alter a verb of the senses here and in the next line, see Matt, Gr. Gr.
885. ᾗ χρῆν. As χρή almost always governs the acc. of the person
(though it governs the dat. in Antig. 736), it might be better to connect
. ᾗ with μετεῖναι; but even then, ἣν would have to be understood
with χρῆν before ξυμπεραίνειν in the next line, in order to account for
κηδεύουσαν being in the accusative.
888. κηδεύουσαν ἣδεσθαι, “to take pleasure in tending.” See the last
part of the note on v. 881. See also note on v. 815.
889. ἐσμὲν οἷόν ἐσμεν. For this euphemistic way of getting over
the direct statement of a disagreeable truth, see note on Hec. v. 873.
For the sentiment, see Tennyson's well-known lines:

Weakness to be wroth with weakness‚ woman’s pleasure, woman’s
Natuffilssade them blinder motions bounded in a shallower brain.
Woman is the lesser man, and all thy passione matched with mine,

Are as moonlight is to sunlight, and as water is to wine.

892. παριέμεσθα, may mean either “ Ι give up,'' or “ I entreat, I ask for
pardon 3 '' the verb being frequently used in each sense, or rather the
two senses running into each other.

894. δεῦτε = δεῦρο ἴτε.

900. This line has two meanings1‚ one for Jason’s ear and one for
Medea. She says to herself, ‘⁴ How Ι am revolving in my mind some of
my hidden purposes,'' i. e., “ I cannot help thinking, even while kissing

her to say, ‘‚‘ How 1 am revolving in my mind the various ills that may
befall them in the dai-k uncertain future.'’ See for similar double
geanings gezerlalmffi Hecuba’s speeches to Polymester‚ as for instance,

901. There, is a double meaning in this line also. Medea means
that there is no chance of their living a long time to stretch their little
arms to her. But Jason thinks she is hoping that they will escape
all the cruel chauces hidden in the future, and live long to embrace

hegil& So constance says in Shakspeare's K. John, iii. 1 ε

’ For I am sick, and capable of fears,
Oppressed with wrongs, and therefore full of ἰείη-ες

Α widow, husbandless, subject to fests, t
A woman, naturally born to fears. ζ’ glo g &Va εὼς.. ,

904. νεῖκος πατρὸς, “my quarrel with your father.” m
906. κατὰ, “ down from.”

908. ἐκεῖνα, “ your previous conduct.”

910. γάμους παρεμπολῶντος means either “ dealing in other mari-iuges
besides his previous one,’' or ‘⁴ dealing in marriage· secretly.'' 'Phe
former meaning is perhaps the better one, as Jason would not throw
blame ou himself. But see v. 587, where Medea finds fault with him
for this. παρεμπολῶντος of course pre-supposes πόσεως or πόα-ως, un·
derstood; and πόσει must be connected with ὀργὰς ποιεῖσθαι. The
dative is used because, as Ροῖῗ remarks, neither πόσεος, nor πόσεως
