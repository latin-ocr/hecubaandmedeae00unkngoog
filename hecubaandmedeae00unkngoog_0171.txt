THE MEDEA. 157

945. If σφε be taken as the object of πείσειν, this line means, “ ii
indeed she is like other women, ready to listen to a lover's prayer-sl·
But if σφε be taken as the subject of πείσειν, and Κρεόντα as the object,
the line will mean, “if indeed she is like other women, easily able to
sway men to her will.·”

946. ξυλλήψομαι, being a verb of participation, governs the gen. of the
object. See Matth. Gr. Gr. ἓ 325.

947. δῶρα is the object of φέροντας in v. 950. καλλιστεύεται, being
derived from a superlative, governs the genitive.

949. λεπτόν τε πέπλον, κ.τ.λ. See note on v. 786.

952. οὐχ’ ἓν, “not in one respect.'’ In this, and the following lines,
notice the undercurrent of fierce and eruel irony.

955. πατρὸς πατὴρ. See note on v. «loo—ors, suis. This pronoun is
not often used in ιι-ρςξᾶγ. See, owever Elmsl ’s n te for other
instanees. §advo-&s-nss-ol'wda cz asthaol..

958. οὔτοι μεμπτ , i. e. “ not to be despised,’' as Jason is intended to
understand the words, and “ not inefficacious to work out Creusa's
death,” as Medea means them.

963. προθήσει χρημάτων, “ she will prefer me (i. e. 'my wishes about
the children), to money.'’

964. μή μοι σύ, sc. τοιαῦτα λέξῃς, vel, ἐμποδὼν γένῃ. Pfl. See also
Hoc. v. 408.-πείθειν δῶρα, κ.τ.λ. This refers to the well-known line,

Δῶρα θεοὺς πείθει, δῶρ’ αἰδοίους βασιλῆας, quoted in Plato de Rep. 390, E.
So Shakespeare says in his Passionate Pilgrim:

The strongest eastle, tower and town, ,
The golden bullet beats it down. Q q σά, 5⁴2 ΛΑΜ
966. κείνης ὀ δαίμων, “Hers is the good ΐ·οι·1;ιιῐιο.”);,]14Ἷῖ s„ k„ ,7- haas

968. ψυχῆς and χρυσοῦ are genitivos of price. maon„

970. δεσπότιν τ’ ἐμὴν. Elmsley and Hermann propose to read δεσ·
ram δ’ ἐμὴν on the ground that when the same person is mentioned
under different designatione, unless τε is used with both clauses, the
adversative particle, with μεν, either expressed or understood, is used
rather than the conjunctive. But though this is generally the case,
there are yet so many cases in which τε is the reading of the MSS.

(see Pflugk’s note), that it is not safe to lay down any arbitrary canon
on the subject. See note on Hee. 534. ¹

981. τὸν ‘Arca κόσμον, “the deathful ornament.'' αὐτὰ = αὐτὴ, as
may beseen bykhJ 3233& ›3³er ,and Pflug& iffi gaess-'Wwid
thgd'd?ti'lgios, i. e. δίκτυον. Elms y quotef‘Hom. Od. xxii. fes-9. ι

Ὦς δ’ ὅτ’ ἃν ἢ κίχλαι τανυσίπτεροι ὴὲ πέλεια.
ἕρκει ἐνιπλήξωσι . . .

989. ὑπεκδραμεῖται is a conjecture of Porson’s for ὑπεκφεύξεται to
enable the line to correspond to v. 982.

990. The metro of this line consists of a preliminary short syllable,
two dactyls and a trocheo, and an ithyphallus. κηδεμὼν is here used as
Elmsley remarks, out of its proper meaning, for κηδεστά.

992. This lino is an ithyphallus. .

994. Hermann translates :—“ Liberis tuis, ignarus letalis eorum vitoe
(i..e. mortis a Medea destinatae), paras uxorique diram necem.” Elmsley,
