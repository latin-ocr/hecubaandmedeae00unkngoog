yield to her maternal feelings. After a short struggle, however, her
desire for revenge conquers all her other impulsos, and she finally
settles herself down to do the horrible deed she has proposed to her·
self (vv. 1002-1082). This scene forms the fifth episode as being
between the fifth and sixth choral odes.

The Chorus, after this exciting speech of Medea’s, just mentioned,
are unable to stand still in their accustomed place, round the thymele,
and sing a stasimon, but march round the orchestra, singing in ana·
paestic measure. It cannot, however, be said that they have commu·
nicated their excitement to their song, since that is, as has already
been stated in the Introduction, a mere frigid repetition of what
Medea has herself said much better in vv. 1025—1037.

reasons. If ἔστρεψας would have scanne ‚ it no doubt would have
been used. As it is, however, ἔτρεψας looks very much like what
Elmsley calls it, manifestvm νοθείας indicium. Klotz, however, defends
it by quoting a passage in which τρέπειν is used in the sense in which
it must be taken here, from Soph. fragm. Rhizot. 1. i.
