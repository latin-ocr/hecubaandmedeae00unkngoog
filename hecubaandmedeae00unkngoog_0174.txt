they are rejected by Dindorf here, and by Porson and others there. In
both places, however, they suit the context, nor does it seem strange
that words so solemn, and announcing so serious a determination, should
be twice uttered. The repetition would sound on the ear like the
knell of doom. 'l'he occurrence of πάντως twice, which is objected to
by Paley, seems accounted for by the line of argument that is running
through Medea’s mind. See the previous line.

there are also hostile προσβολαί. .

i. 2, “ A hot temper leaps over a cold decree ε such a hare is madness,
the youth, to skip over the mashes of good counsel, the cripple.'' So,

1082. ἁμίλλας, “ argumentations,” such as we have examples of in
Plato’s Dialogues. The whole passage is, as Paley sa s, an apology for
putting such sage reflections into the mouths of a C orus of women;
female education being at a very low cbb in Gmece.
