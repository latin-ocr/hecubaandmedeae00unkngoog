THE MEDEA. 161

corresponding “but yet to some ς ” a clause with μεν being always
followed by one with δὲ, either expressed or understood. The reading
in the text is Elmsley’s conjecture for παῦρον δὴ γένος ἐν πολλαῖσιν,
κ’ἲ393. προφέρειν . . . τῶν γειναμένων, “excel those who are parents?
But Tennyson’s doctrine is the sounder one:

, ’Tis better to have loved and lost,
Than never to have loved at all.

’ 1095. ἡδὺ and ἀνιαρόν are in the neuter singular, though predicates
to a plural masculine subject. This, however, is often the case in
Greek. See Matt. Gr. Gr. ἓ 437.

1109. εἰ δὲ κυρήσας δαίμων οὗτος = εἷ δὲ δαίμων οὗτος κυρήσας ἔσται,
“ if such (ill) fortune should come to pass.’' What the “ill fortune ’'
is, is shown in the next verse by Ocinarus. For other instances of a
participle following εἰ, without the insertion of the copula, Hermann,
in anote on Agam. 404, as quoted by Paley, says: “Id reete fieri

nature of the subject, as has been already stated in the Introduction.
This is divided into three parts3 of which the first consists of an
