of the (luds, and to her to abstain at the last moment from committing
so foul a crime; the second is responsive to the cries of the children
as they are being murdered; and the third expresses horror at the
deed when done, quotes the only instance on record of a similar one,
and laments that love should be productive of so much that is evil
vv, 1251-92 .

( Τὲιο ΙῙἛ i)ncluded between this and the previous ode form the
sixt e is e.

1117? οῖ προβήσεται. Here ot is put for ὅποι, as ὃς is sometimes put
for τίς. Elmsley, however, remarks that, though it is usual to say
οἶδά σε ὓς οἵ, it is unusual to say οὐκ οῖδά σε ὃς εἶ, because, wherever
there is any doubt as to that which is spoken of, the interrogative
forms are preferred. Hence he hardly approves of the use of οἳ at
all in this passage, as doubt is expressed. For the same reason he
disapproves of ᾖ in v. 341.

1123. ναΐαν ἀπήνην, “a naval chariot.'’ i. e. “ a ship.'’ So νάϊον ὄχημα
is used in Eur. Ι.. Τ. 410. The advice of course is to get into a

. ship or into a chariot as soon as possible, and run away at once.

1129. For this use of μὲν without a corresponding δὲ in questions,
see note on v. 67 6.

1133. μὴ σπέρχου, “ Do not be hasty with me.”

1143. στέγας = εἷς στέγας.

1144. θαυμάζομεν, “look on as our mistress.’'

1147. προῦκαλύψατο, “ veiled.”

1151. οὐ μὴ used interrogatively with the second person of the future
indicative is equivalent to a strong prohibition. Thus οὐ μὴ λαλήσειςς
= “Will you not chatter‘l” i. e. ‘⁶ will you not hold your tongue‘3'’
“ Do hold your tongue.'’ It must be remembered that οὐ qualifies
each of the five verbs, ἔσει, παύσει, στρέψειε, δέξει and παραιτήσει, and
that μὴ belongs only to ἔσει. Hence, v. 1151 contains a prohibition,⁴
and the next three lines contain requests.

1153. πόσις sc. νομίζῃ.

1154. For the gen. after παραιτεῖσθαι, see note on v. 942. ·

1155. ἐμὴν χάριν = mea qratia, mea causa.

1156. οὐκ ἠνέσχετο, “did not romain obdurate.'’

11157. ᾔνεσε, “promised'’ See Eur. Alc. 12, and Hom. 11. xviii.

1161. σχῃματίζεται κόμην, “ arranges her hair.”

h 11162. ἄψυχον εἰκὼ . . . σώματος, “the lifeless image (i. e. reflection) of
er od .’'

1164.y‹‘z.6pbn βαίνουσα, “walking mincingly,’⁸ as if conscious of the
pretty dress she had on. See Isaiah, iii. 16, “ Walking and mincing
as they go.'’ παλλεῦκῳ ποδί. Ηοι· foot must not be looked on as un·
sandalled. but appearing whitely above the sandal. So Schiine.

1166. ’τένοντ’ ἐς ὀρθὸν . . . σκοπουμένῃ, “ looking at herself towards (in '

the direction of) her stretched out foot‚” i. e. to see whether the dress
fell in graceful folds. Paley quotes Bacch. 938, τάνθένδε δ’ ὀρθῶς παρὰ
τένοντ’ ἔχει πέπλος, to show that τένοντα must here mean the foot and
not the neck, as Matthiae and others have thought.

1168. λεχρία, “ oblique,” i. e. “staggering.”

1169. κῶλα is the acc. of the part affected.

1170. μὴ κόμαι πεσεῖν = ὥστε μὴ χόμαι πεσεῖν. .
