1172. Πανὸς ὀργάς. Pflugk quotes what Pausanias x. 23, 5, says of
the Gauls‚ ἐν δὲ τῇ νυκτὶ φόβος σφίσιν ἐμπίπτει Πανικός· τὰ ’γὰρ ἀπὸ αἰτίας
οὐδεμιᾶς δείματα ἐκ τούτου φασὶ γενέσθαι. Sc, t00, Bacchus, Ceres, the
Nymphs, δια, were supposed to have the power of producing phrensy.
Hence, the words lymphatus, cerritus (according to some), νυμφόληπτος
and others, and our own word panio.

1173. ἀνωλόλυξε, “raised a well-omened cry,-—a cry of prayer,’' much
as it used to be the custom to say “ God bless you,'' when any one
sneezed, to avert any ill-consequences.—81& στόμα. This use of διὰ, with
the acc. to signify clm-omli, is not to be found in prose-writers.

1174. ἀπὸ . . . στρέφουσαν is by tmesis for ἀποστρέφουσαν.

1176. ἀντίμολπον . . . ὀλολινγῆς, “ contrary in sound to the well-
omened cry (ὄλολυγῆς) she had uttered before.'' Pflugk quotes
Hesych. T. 2, 744, Ὀλολυγή, φωνὴ γυναικῶν ἢν ποιοῦνται ἐν τοῖς ἱεροῖς
εὐχόμεναι.

1177. ἦ μὲν . . . ἦ δὲ, sc. προσπόλων.

1181. ἕλκων κῶλον, pedem trabeae, is probably put in, as Paley sug-
gests, to show that the man spoken of in the next line as measuring
the time by the distance he can traverse in it, is represented as walkiny.
δρόμου depends on τερμόνων. The Olympio stadium consisted of six
πλέθρα, each πλέθρον being a hundred Greek feet. Hence, Glauce is
represented as remaining silent as long as it would take a quick walker
to walk from the starting—point (βαλβίς, γραμμή) of the Olympic
stadium to the goal (τέρμα, τέλος, καμπτήρ).

1183. ἐξ ἆναύδου, “ after having remained speechless,'' is probably, as
Paley suggests, independent of ὄμματος, and used just like ἐξ ἀνάγκης,
ἐξ ἀέλπτου, and other adverbial expressions—{tc μύσαντος ὄμματος,
“after her eye had been closed.'' Pflugk, however, prefers to supply
ὄμματος throughout, quoting the expression, Luminibus tacitis, in Vir.
AEn. iv. 364. So Soph. OEd. Col. 182, ἀμαυρῷ κώλῳ.

1185. For the dat. after ἐπεστρατεύετο, see Matth. Gr. Gr. 402, α.

1187. ἵει is the past imperfect, as if from ἶέω.

1194. μᾶλλον δὶς τόσως τ’. “ still m01·e; ay, twice as much.''—3Adpt·
πετο. So Homer uses the passive in 11. xxii. 134. ἐλάμπετο εἴκελος
αὐγῇ, aud elsewhere3 the active voice having been more commonly tran-
sitive than intransitive in early times.

1197. κατάστασις, “ condition, appearance.”

1200. ὀστέων must be pronounced as a dissyllable.-—&o··re πεύκινον
δάκρυ, “ as the gum of the fir-tree comes off from the trunk.’'

1201. γναθμοῖς . . . φαρμάκων, “under the jaws of the poisonous
drugs.'' So Morgan le Fay, King Arthur's sister, sends a poisoned
mantle, thick with precious stones, to her brother ς and King Arthur,
being warned against wearing it by the Lady of the Lake, puts it per·
force on the messenger‚ “ and forthwith the garment burst into
a flame aud burned the damsel into cinders. When the king saw that,
he hated that false witch, Morgan le Fay, with all his heart, and
eveirmore was deadly quarrel between her and Arthur to their lives‘
en .”

1203. τύχην . . . διδάσκαλον, “her missortune our teacher.” So the
common proverb, παθήματα μαθήματα.

1209. γέροντα τύμβον is equivalent to τυμβογέροντα, “ one walking
with one foot in the grave.'’ So Ι.. and S. quote cmpuli decue from
