THE MEDEA. 165

μιάσματα, and ξυνῳδὰ and πίτνοντα will agree with ἄχη. So Pflugk
understands the passage.

1271. It must be remembered that the children are supposed to be
speaking from the inside of the palace, the outside of which only is
visible to the spectatore, according to the well—known rule, that nothing
Rorlgible or incredible should be acted visibly on the stage. See Hor.

N e pueros coram populo Medea trucidet.

1273-1275 are dochmiac dimeters corresponding to 1282, 1283,
1275. The dawdling of the Chorus, at the moment when immediate
action alone would be effectual‚ is necessary for the preservation
of the neutra] part always taken by the Chorus, but seems intole-
rable to a modern mind. So the Chorus in the Agamemnon
talk about helping Agamemnon till he is past help. See AEsch. Ag.
vv. 1343—13 1. ”

1276 is a dochmius corresponding to 1287.
h1278. ἀρκύων ξίφους, “the net of the sword‚’' i.e. “destruction by
t e sword.”

1279. This verse is a dochmiac dimeter corresponding to 1290.

1280. This line consiste of a dochmius and a proceleusmatic, or

1281. This line is a dochmiac dimeter corresponding to 1292.
-αὐτόχειρι μοίρᾳ, “‚with fateful stroke given by your own hand.”

Melicertes, into the sea3 but the common story is, that Athamas had
killed Lem-chus, and was going to kill Melicertes, when Ino fled
Xigh him and threw herself with him over the cliff to escape from

t amas.

1290. ἔτι, “ still,” i. e. “ after this.’' N otice that the ὦ at the begin·
ning of the next line should have been printed at the end of this line
to complete the dochmius.

1291. roaga-avon. For the scanning of this proceleusmatic, see

Sonus IX.

Jsson enters to save his children from the avengers of Creon and
Glauce, and is informed by the Chorus that they have been already
