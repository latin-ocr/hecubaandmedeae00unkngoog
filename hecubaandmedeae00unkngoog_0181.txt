THE MEDEA. 167

1347. πάραεπάρεστι. So also in v. 1408.
1351. μακρὰν is an adverb. “ Μακρᾶν, ut cetera adverbia in αν desi·

nentia, ultimam producit.” Elmsley.

1356. οὔτε . . . . οὔτε have been altered by Elmsley and Dindorf into
οὐδὲ . . . . οὐδὲ, on the ground that οὐ is followed by the latter and not
by the former. The alteration is, however, maintained by Hermann to
be unnecessary, on the ground that Euripides was thinking of the con-
struction οὔτε σὺ, οὔτε ἡ τύραννος, οὔτε Κρέων τερπνὸν διάξει βίοτον. For
a similar irregularity with regard to particles, see v. 1316.

1361. καύτή γε, “ Yes, and you too.''

1362. λύειελυσιτελεῖ. See v. 566.

1366. ὕβρις--ἧ σὴ ὕβρις, the article and pronoun being supplied from
the subsequent part of the line.

1374. στυγεῖ, i. e. “ You are as hateful to me as Ι am to you.'’

1375. ῥᾴδιοι δ’ ἀπαλλαγαί. See note on v. 236. Ῥᾴδιος here has only

two terminatione.
1377. “ If you want a divorce, let me have the bodies of my children,

and Ι will release you.’'

1379. ’Ἥρας τέμενος ἆκραίας. Elmsley remarks that Medea’s next
words show that the place of butial she had selected was out of
the territory of Corinth, and then quotes Livy, xxxii. 23, “ Promon-
torium est adversus Sicyonem, J unonis quam vocant Acraeam, in altum
excurrens: trajectus inde Corinthum, septem millia ferme passuum.”

1382. σεμνὴν ἑορτὴν καὶ τέλη. Elmsley quotes the Scholiasta as say·
ing Ἥραια πένθιμος ἑορτὴ παρὰ Κορινθίοις.

1387. κάρα σόν. The possessive pronoun is not often found joined
with the accusative of the part affected. See Matt. Gr. Gr. ξ 424,
obs. 2, who quotes Eur. Helen. 1192. λύπῃ σὰς διέφθαρσαι φρένας.
Pflugk quotes the Scholiast for the manner of Jason's death:
Ἰστορεῖται Ἰάσων τέλει τοιούτῳ χρήσασθαι · κοιμώμενον ’γὰρ αὐτὸν ὑπὸ
τὴν Ἀργὼ nav-warewast ὑπὸ πολλοῦ χρόνον, μέρος τι ταύτης ἐκπεσὸν
κατὰ τῆς κεφαλῆς ἔκρουσεν.

1396. μένε καὶ γῆρας. This is a ferocious speech of Medea's. “ Wait
till you are an old man. Then you will find out what loneliness is.”
So Coriolanus is said to have declared that no one could tell all the
bitterness of exile, till old age fell upon him.

1398. σέ ’γε πημαίνουσα, i. e. ἔκταν.

1399. This is either a confusion of the two constructione φιλίου
{iffi ‘'321“‘2222 ἓξὲξ ωξρῗὲἷρῇἳᾶοἰ.ἕέἕέῖρῖἰῖῐῗὶξξίἶῖ.θ“ “⁰⁰⁰¹ding ω

1404. οὐκ ἔστι, i. e. οὐκ ἔξεστι. =

1405. This line is a proof that anapaestic lines must be scanned con·
guncilisly, like &0113le2 gwo lines in a sapphic stanza. See for instance,

or. . Carm. . ‚ ε

Jove non probante uxorius amnis.

1408. See note on v. 1347.

1409. ἑπιθοάζω, “ Ι sit as suppliant about; 1 pray the gods about,” is
supposed to be derived from θαάσσίιν orkodfflrsw, d: ffbsztg'„ Dindorf
